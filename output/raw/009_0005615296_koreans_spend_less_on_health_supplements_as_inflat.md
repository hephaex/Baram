South Korean consumers are cutting back on health supplement spending as the economic slowdown continues and real incomes shrink due to high inflation.According to the Korea Health Functional Food Association on Thursday, the domestic health supplement market shrank to around 5 trillion won ($3.5 billion) in 2025, just three years after topping 6 trillion won for the first time in 2022.The market grew rapidly from 4.89 trillion won in 2019 to 5.7 trillion won in 2021 and 6.4 trillion won in 2022. It, however, recorded 6 trillion won in 2024 before shrinking further to 5.9 trillion won last year.“Even launching mid- to low-priced products and strengthening online sales hasn’t provided a clear breakthrough,” said an industry insider.Despite the slowdown, the low barriers to entry have led to a continued surge in the number of supplement companies.Data from the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety show the number of companies entering the health supplement business increased from 509 in 2019 to 591 in 2023.Major food groups, including CJ CheilJedang Corp, Nongshim Co., and Binggrae Co., have expanded their offerings. Samyang Foods Co. launched a plant-based health brand last year.Yet the crowded field has intensified price competition without delivering visible sales growth.“The market is shrinking, but cosmetics and pharmaceutical companies keep entering,” said an industry inside. The outlook is increasingly bleak.”
