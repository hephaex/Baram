(LEAD) nuclear reactor-operation(LEAD) Nuclear safety watchdog approves Saeul-3 reactor operation(ATTN: UPDATES with more info in paras 3-4, minor edits; ADDS photo) SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- South Korea&#x27;s nuclear watchdog gave an official nod to the operation of the Saeul-3 reactor Tuesday, with its commercial launch set for next year. The Nuclear Safety and Security Commission made the decision after holding a meeting on whether to approve the operation of the Saeul-3, a homegrown APR1400 reactor located at the Saeul Nuclear Power Site in the southeastern port city of Ulsan. &quot;In accordance with legal procedures and on scientific and technological grounds, we have thoroughly inspected the safety of the Saeul-3,&quot; Choi Won-ho, chairperson of the commission, said in a release. &quot;We plan to continue strictly checking safety through pre-use inspections during nuclear fuel loading and the test-run process,&quot; Choi added.

The approval comes about two weeks after the commission delayed its final decision in its initial meeting. With Tuesday&#x27;s decision, the unit, whose construction began in 2016, will undergo a pilot run over the next six months. The Saeul-3 marks the first South Korean nuclear reactor designed to withstand aircraft attacks, featuring walls measuring 137 centimeters in thickness, 15 centimeters thicker than those of earlier reactors. The reactor has a spent nuclear fuel storage capacity of up to 60 years, sufficient to store the entire volume generated over its design life. The unit was formerly known as Kori-5 before being renamed in 2022.
