(LEAD) S Korea-USFK commander(LEAD) USFK commander says S. Korea &#x27;not simply responding to threats&#x27; on Korean Peninsula(ATTN: ADDS remarks, details in last 3 paras; CHANGES photo)By Kim Hyun-soo SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- The commander of American forces stationed in South Korea said Monday that Seoul &quot;is not simply responding to threats&quot; on the Korean Peninsula, as Washington has urged Seoul and other regional allies to contribute to safeguarding maritime security in the Indo-Pacific. Gen. Xavier Brunson, commander of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), made the remark at a forum on the alliance with the U.S., citing the new U.S. National Security Strategy that emphasized the need for Seoul and Tokyo to build capabilities to defend the First Island Chain, a key perimeter for America&#x27;s preeminence against China in the Pacific, while mentioning nothing about North Korea. &quot;The recently published U.S. National Security Strategy reflects this reality by emphasizing the decisive importance of not only this region but of Korea herself, and the vital role that capable, like-minded partners play in keeping the Indo-Pacific stable and predictable,&quot; Brunson said in a speech at the forum. &quot;And within that context, Korea is not simply responding to threats on the peninsula. Korea sits at the crossroads of broader regional dynamics that shape the balance of power across Northeast Asia,&quot; he added.

With regard to North Korea&#x27;s military cooperation with Russia, particularly after the North&#x27;s dispatch of its troops to support Moscow&#x27;s war against Ukraine, Brunson said Pyongyang has made a &quot;long-term strategic decision.&quot; North Korea&#x27;s &quot;deepening military partnership with Russia, such as exchanging munitions for advanced technologies,&quot; has advanced the North&#x27;s missile and nuclear programs &quot;in dangerous ways,&quot; Brunson said. Compounded with other factors, such as the North&#x27;s rejection of peaceful unification and rewriting the constitution to designate the South as its &quot;primary foe,&quot; the Korean Peninsula cannot be viewed as a &quot;legacy commitment,&quot; as the threat itself is also modernizing, Brunson said. In response to these threats, Brunson underscored alliance modernization as &quot;more than just a slogan&quot; across the U.N. Command, the South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command and the USFK, noting they are approaching scenarios as complex, multidomain problems that require faster decision-making and tighter integration. The USFK commander also said improving practical cooperation with Japan, such as real-time missile warning data and more routine trilateral training, adds resilience and complicates the adversary&#x27;s planning. sookim@yna.co.kr(END)
