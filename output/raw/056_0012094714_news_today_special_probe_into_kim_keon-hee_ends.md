[LEAD]The special counsel has wrapped up its six-month investigation into former First Lady Kim Keon-hee.It says she leveraged her position to accept expensive gifts and played a wide-ranging role in personnel appointments and election nominations.[REPORT]A special counsel team, launched in July, has wrapped up its 180-day probe into allegations involving former First Lady Kim Keon-hee.It announced on Monday the final results of its investigation into 31 cases against Kim.Special counsel Min Joong-ki concluded that Kim had used her status as a president’s spouse to receive expensive gifts and broadly intervened in personnel decisions and election nominations.Min Joong-ki / Special counselAs Kim used her influence as the president’s spouse, the nation’s public system was hugely damaged.The special counsel team found that the amount of money and valuables received by Kim totaled about 370 million won, or some 258,000 U.S. dollars.Accusing Kim of selling government positions, Min said she was not punished under the wing of her husband, former President Yoon Suk Yeol.But it was not found whether or not Kim colluded with the former president in the alleged sale of public offices.Regarding Kim’s ties with the shaman Jeon Seong-bae and the Unification Church, the team concluded that the church had asked the Yoon administration for business favors and state personnel and material resources had been mobilized, branding it as a typical case of collusion between politics and religion.But the team failed to establish a direct link between Kim and allegations of stock manipulation involving Sambu Engineering and Construction or preferential treatment related to the construction of the Yangpyeong expressway.The special counsel team indicted 66 people including Kim, Unification Church leader Han Hak-ja and lawmaker Kwon Seong-dong in 31 cases.The team says it plans to hand over remaining cases that require more investigation to the National Office of Investigation.■ 제보하기▷ 전화 : 02-781-1234, 4444▷ 이메일 : kbs1234@kbs.co.kr▷ 카카오톡 : &#x27;KBS제보&#x27; 검색, 채널 추가▷ 네이버, 유튜브에서 KBS뉴스를 구독해주세요!
