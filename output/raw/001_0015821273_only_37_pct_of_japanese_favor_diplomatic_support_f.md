global survey-peaceOnly 37 pct of Japanese favor diplomatic support for peace on Korean Peninsula: poll SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- Only 36.7 percent of Japanese people said they support efforts to provide diplomatic support to achieve peace on the Korean Peninsula, hovering well below the global average, a survey showed Tuesday. The percentage of Japanese citizens who backed the idea of offering economic and military support also stood at 25.8 percent and 12.7 percent, respectively, according to a report released by the Korea Institute for National Unification. The online survey was conducted from Aug. 11-18 on 1,000 respondents in seven countries -- Japan, Germany, Mongolia, Sweden, Italy, Canada, Poland -- and 2,000 respondents in the United States. Among the eight nations, Japan recorded the lowest figure in terms of all of the diplomatic, economic and military support, the poll showed. Except Japan, the percentage of respondents from the seven countries came to a range of 63.8-76.6 percent in supporting diplomatic solutions, while 40.8-63.8 percent favored the economic support. On the military support, the corresponding percentage reached 24.2-60.3 percent. In the U.S., 52.1 percent of respondents said they supported military support, though U.S. President Donald Trump has strengthened his America First policy in his second term. On the issue of Korean unification, approval exceeded 40 percent in all surveyed countries except Japan, where support stood at just 29.3 percent.
