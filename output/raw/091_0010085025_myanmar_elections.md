Myanmar holds general electionsA voter shows his pinky finger marked with ink after casting a ballot in the general election in Yangon, Myanmar, 28 December 2025. The State Administration Council (SAC), Myanmar&#x27;s military government, will hold its first national vote since the February 2021 coup in a multi-stage general election, with the first phase scheduled for 28 December 2025 and the second for 11 January 2026. Over 50 political parties have registered to participate in the election, according to the Union Election Commission (UEC). The government dissolved the main pro-democracy opposition, the National League for Democracy (NLD), in March 2023. EPA/NYEIN CHAN NAING
