currency-forecast Experts predict U.S. dollar-won at 1,420 level on annual average SEOUL, Dec. 28 (Yonhap) -- Experts on Sunday viewed the 1,420 level as an annual average for the won against the U.S. dollar, as financial authorities stepped up verbal intervention to arrest the won&#x27;s slide. The Korean won closed at 1,440.3 won against the U.S. dollar on Friday, marking the lowest level since Nov. 4, according to data from Seoul Money Brokerage Services. With financial authorities stepping up verbal intervention to curb the won&#x27;s weakness, the won rose sharply by over 30 won against the U.S. dollar at one point last week.

&quot;We are seeing a new psychological resistance level being formed and the won-dollar exchange rate&#x27;s upward momentum being curbed. The government&#x27;s stabilization measures are likely to remain significant till the end of the year,&quot; Baek Seok-hyun, an economist at Shinhan Bank&#x27;s S&amp;T Center, said. Baek predicted the won-dollar exchange rate to close at the 1,400 won to 1,420 won range by the end of the year. Economist Lim Hwan-yeol from Woori Bank has set the year-end won-dollar exchange rate at around 1,440 won, noting the likelihood of export companies releasing their dollar reserves into the market remains high. The won-dollar exchange rate at the end of the year is significant because it serves as a benchmark for companies and financial institutions to evaluate their foreign-currency-denominated liabilities in their financial statements. The highest year-end won-dollar exchange rate was recorded in 1997, during the financial crisis, when the won was quoted at 1,695 won per U.S. dollar. fairydust@yna.co.kr(END)
