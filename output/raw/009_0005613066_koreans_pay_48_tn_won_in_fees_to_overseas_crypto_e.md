# Koreans pay 4.8 tn won in fees to overseas crypto exchanges this year

South Korean digital-asset investors are estimated to have paid 4.77 trillion won ($3.31 billion) in trading fees to major overseas cryptocurrency exchanges this year, nearly 2.7 times the combined operating revenue of the country‘s five largest domestic exchanges last year.According to data released Sunday by Tiger Research and Kaiko, Korean investors paid more than 1 trillion won in fees to Binance and Bybit this year alone. Other major overseas platforms, including OKX (580 billion won), Bitget (266.3 billion won) and Huobi (74.4 billion won), also generated substantial revenue from Korean users.The scale of fees reflects a sharp increase in the number of Korean investors using overseas platforms. From January through September, Koreans purchased 124 trillion won worth of digital assets on foreign exchanges. For the full year, that figure is expected to reach 160 trillion won, according to Tiger Research—more than triple the 45.5 trillion won recorded in 2023.The analysis combines estimates of Korean investors’ market share on global exchanges with data on asset outflows from wallets held at domestic exchanges, adjusted for derivatives trading patterns.Industry observers attribute the trend to the stark contrast between domestic and overseas platforms. While Korean exchanges face tight regulations that limit the rollout of new products, global exchanges offer a wider array of investment instruments. Perpetual futures—products unique to digital-asset markets—are already standard overseas, and platforms such as Binance and Bybit allow leveraged positions worth tens of times an investor’s assets.Binance also operates “Binance Alpha,” which allows trading of tokens before formal listing, offering access to high-risk investments with risk disclosures—services unavailable on Korean exchanges. Despite Korea being the world’s second-largest crypto market by trading volume, domestic platforms lag global peers in revenue generation.Tiger Research noted that while Korea shows some of the world’s most active digital-asset investment behavior, it remains far behind in ecosystem development, technological innovation and global competitiveness. The liquidity and trading demand created by Korean investors have, paradoxically, fueled the growth of overseas platforms for years, it said.The disparity is evident in revenue structures. As of the third quarter, U.S.-based Coinbase derived just 45.14 percent of its revenue from retail trading fees, with significant contributions from blockchain rewards such as staking (9.88 percent), stablecoin-related revenue including USDC (18.98 percent), and institutional trading fees (10.85 percent).By contrast, Korean exchanges remain almost entirely dependent on retail trading fees. Dunamu, operator of market leader Upbit, generated 97.94 percent of its revenue from retail trading fees, while second-largest Bithumb reported a comparable figure of 98.38 percent.Industry officials argue that policy should shift from strict regulation toward fostering growth. A senior executive at a domestic exchange said companies need room to introduce and test new services to build competitiveness, adding that without access to derivatives and other products offered overseas, meaningful competition is impossible.The constraints extend to traditional financial institutions. While global financial firms are expanding into digital assets, Korean institutions remain restricted by rules separating finance from crypto businesses. Digital-asset services now extend beyond cryptocurrencies to tokenization of real-world assets such as real estate and securities, as well as blockchain-based payments and remittances, many of which are already commercially viable overseas.In the United States, brokerage firm Robinhood has launched digital-asset trading and recently introduced prediction markets. Conversely, Coinbase has expanded into stock trading and prediction markets. Such models remain effectively impossible in Korea, where even limited trials require regulatory sandbox approval and face constraints on speed and scope.Although discussions on phase-two digital-asset legislation have recently gained momentum in the National Assembly, progress remains slow. Industry participants also point to ongoing disputes over who should be allowed to issue stablecoins, noting that Korea lags behind jurisdictions such as the United States and Europe, which have introduced frameworks like the GENIUS Act and MiCA.Calls are also growing to allow foreign investors access to Korean crypto exchanges. Currently, such participation is effectively blocked due to anti-money-laundering rules. Industry officials argue that opening the market—potentially after the introduction of a won-based stablecoin—could boost demand for the Korean currency. Without narrowing the service gap with overseas platforms, they warn, more capital is likely to flow abroad, adding pressure to the already-weak won.
