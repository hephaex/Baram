# Kakao Pay expands multilingual support for foreign residents in Korea

Kakao Pay Corp. announced on Monday that it has expanded multilingual support for foreign residents in South Korea to include money transfer and payment services.Following the launch of a visually optimized Global Home screen tailored for foreign users, the company aims to substantially improve financial accessibility by widening language options at key stages of service execution.The multilingual environment focuses on core features most frequently used by foreign residents in their daily lives.In line with the roadmap announced at the launch of Global Home, Kakao Pay has connected multilingual support from guidance screens through to actual service execution, creating a seamless user flow.The money transfer service now offers full multilingual support across all major functions, including the initial entry screen, open-chat transfers, bank account transfers, friend-to-friend transfers, and QR-code transfers.This allows foreign users to complete the entire transfer process in their preferred language.For payment services, multilingual support has been applied to the card registration screen within the payment window – the first interface users encounter.The service currently supports English, Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean, and automatically adjusts based on the language settings of a user’s smartphone. If a device is set to an unsupported language, the interface defaults to Korean.Kakao Pay also said it offers a customized interface that suggests switching to the multilingual environment when a user is identified as a foreign resident.“With the number of foreign residents in Korea surpassing 2.6 million, we decided to expand language support first for money transfer and payment services, which they use most frequently in their daily life,” the company said. “We will continue to carefully assess the needs of foreign users, expand the scope of our financial services, and establish ourselves as an essential financial platform for foreign residents in Korea.”
