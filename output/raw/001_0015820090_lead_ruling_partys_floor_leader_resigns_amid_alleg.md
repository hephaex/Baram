(LEAD) ruling party-floor leader (LEAD) Ruling party&#x27;s floor leader resigns amid allegations of misconduct, abuse of power(ATTN: UPDATES throughout with details; ADDS photo) SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- The floor leader of the ruling Democratic Party (DP), Rep. Kim Byung-kee, resigned from his post Tuesday amid mounting allegations of misconduct, including receiving preferential treatment and abusing his power. Kim announced his resignation during a party meeting at the National Assembly as he apologized over the allegations, such as using free accommodation provided by Korean Air Co. in the past and other misconduct involving his family. &quot;There were acts that fell far short of the public&#x27;s common sense and point of view, and my shortcomings are entirely responsible. I truly apologize,&quot; Kim said. &quot;This (resignation) decision isn&#x27;t meant to evade responsibility but is my resolve to take greater responsibility after determining right from wrong,&quot; he added.

Kim said his resignation was also aimed at avoiding putting a burden upon the ruling party and President Lee Jae Myung&#x27;s administration. Kim had faced pressure to step down after the allegations recently surfaced, which also include instructing aides to help his son with his work and his wife misusing district council funds for personal use. His resignation comes 200 days after taking the ruling party&#x27;s floor leadership.
