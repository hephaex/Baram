NK leader-politicsN. Korea&#x27;s Kim attends ceremony marking adoption of its constitution SEOUL, Dec. 28 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has attended a ceremony marking the country&#x27;s promulgation of its Socialist Constitution more than half a century ago, the North&#x27;s state media reported Sunday. A national flag-raising and oath-taking ceremony was held at the Mansudae Assembly Hall the previous day to mark Constitution Day, with Kim in attendance, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. North Korea observes Dec. 27 as Constitutional Day in commemoration of the promulgation of its constitution on the same day in 1972. Kim made a commemorative oath marking Constitution Day, followed by participants who vowed to &quot;dedicate themselves ... by always remaining faithful to promoting the people&#x27;s well-being and the growth and development of the state,&quot; the KCNA said.

Kim also commended labor innovators and meritorious persons invited to the event, for helping make this year &quot;one of a great turn to be specially recorded in the history of the development&quot; of North Korea. &quot;The country is prospering and our cause is dynamically advancing without a moment&#x27;s stagnation, thanks to the well-known and unsung patriots who devote their diligent and sincere efforts to the work at their workplaces and posts,&quot; the KCNA quoted Kim as saying. He said the government &quot;firmly believe in and exclusively rely on high patriotic enthusiasm of the people in the historic struggle for the overall development of socialist construction.&quot; The leader also expressed hope that they would continue to &quot;creditably play their role as the vanguard and standard-bearers of the times.&quot; The invitees included female footballers and coaches who won the 2025 FIFA U-17 Women&#x27;s World Cup earlier this year. Kim personally met them and wished them greater successes in the future, the news agency said.
