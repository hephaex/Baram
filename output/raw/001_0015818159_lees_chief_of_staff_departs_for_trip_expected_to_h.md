presidential aide-arms exports Lee&#x27;s chief of staff departs for trip expected to help arms exportsBy Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Jae Myung&#x27;s chief of staff has departed for a trip as a presidential envoy for strategic economic cooperation, Cheong Wa Dae said Monday, a move widely seen as aimed at helping South Korea&#x27;s defense exports. Kang Hoon-sik, the presidential chief of staff, departed the country on Sunday, the office said, without disclosing his destination and itinerary. Cheong Wa Dae said details on Kang&#x27;s trip will be released later. The latest trip follows Kang&#x27;s earlier visits to Poland, Romania and Norway in October and to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia in November. During those trips, he focused on expanding cooperation in the defense industry and supporting Korean companies seeking overseas contracts. Kang was appointed as Lee&#x27;s special envoy in October to help carry out the administration&#x27;s goal of positioning South Korea as one of the world&#x27;s four largest arms exporters. The office said Kang plans to undertake such missions on three occasions through the first half of next year.
