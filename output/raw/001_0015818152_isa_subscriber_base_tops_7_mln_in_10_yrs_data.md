individual savings accounts-tally ISA subscriber base tops 7 mln in 10 yrs: data SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- Less than 10 years after their launch, the number of individual savings accounts (ISAs) has surpassed the 7 million mark, data showed Monday. A total of 7.19 million people held ISAs as of end-November, with deposits in the accounts totaling 46.5 trillion won (US$32.14 billion), according to the data from the Korea Financial Investment Association. ISAs allow customers to either select investment products, such as stocks, funds and deposits, themselves or have financial firms manage their assets on their behalf. The financial product was introduced in March 2016 as part of government efforts to help individuals build wealth through a one-stop savings scheme while providing tax benefits. Brokerage-offered ISAs came to 6.14 million accounts, or 84 percent of the total, as of the end of last month, while trust-type accounts stood at 919,000, representing 12.8 percent of the total, the data showed.
