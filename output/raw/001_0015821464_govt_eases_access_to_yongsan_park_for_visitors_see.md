Yongsan park-entryGov&#x27;t eases access to Yongsan park for visitors, seeks name change SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- The land ministry said Tuesday it has eased access to a park near the former presidential office in Yongsan, removing a reservation process for security verification purposes. The move comes after the presidential office, previously located near the defense ministry compound, completed its relocation to Cheong Wa Dae in central Seoul, easing security measures in the surrounding area. Previously, visitors to Yongsan Children&#x27;s Garden had to submit their information in advance, raising criticism the policy prevents people from freely visiting the park. Alongside the updated entry policy, the ministry said it plans to operate the park in a more efficient and transparent manner, and seek to change its name after accepting public feedback. As part of efforts to better manage the park, the ministry said it plans to conduct regular monitoring of air and soil quality, and disclose the results to the public. The part in front of the former presidential office occupies around 300,000 square meters of land previously used as a base by U.S. forces stationed in South Korea. It was named Yongsan Children&#x27;s Garden and opened to the public in May 2023 under the former administration following yearlong construction.
