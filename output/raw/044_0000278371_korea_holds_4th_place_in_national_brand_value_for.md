The index surveys some 1,600 experts across 62 countries on 39 target nations, according to the institute.Korea jumped from sixth place in 2021 to fourth in 2022 and has held that position ever since.The event, co-hosted by the Institute of Nation Brand Promotion and the Institute for Policy and Strategy on National Competitiveness, also honored individuals and organizations across 14 categories for elevating Korea&#x27;s image on the world stage.Actress Lim Yoona received the Global Pop Culture Influence award. A member of the legendary girl group Girls&#x27; Generation who has also made her mark as an actor, she expanded her international reach this year through the popular K-drama &quot;Bon Appetit, Your Majesty.&quot;Badminton star Ahn Se-young took the Global Sports Leadership prize after a dominant season in which she claimed 11 titles and became the first athlete to be named BWF Player of the Year for the third year running. Fencing Olympic gold medalist Oh Sang-wook earned the Global Sports Championship honor.Past recipients in these categories include figure skater Kim Yuna, footballer Son Heung-min, pianist Lim Yun-chan, and actors Lee Min-ho and Lee Jung-jae.Among institutions, the National Museum of Korea was recognized after its annual attendance surpassed five million for the first time this year.
