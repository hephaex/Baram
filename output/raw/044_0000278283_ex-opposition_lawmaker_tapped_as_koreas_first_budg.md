Former lawmaker Lee Hye-hoon (Yonhap)South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has named former lawmaker Lee Hye-hoon as the country’s first budget minister, in a surprise appointment that brings an opposition figure into the new administration.The presidential office said Sunday that Lee Hye-hoon will head the Ministry of Planning and Budget, a new body set to be launched next year as the government separates the budget-making function from the Ministry of Economy and Finance.Lee, 61, served three terms in the National Assembly during the 17th, 18th and 20th sessions and was affiliated with conservative parties that preceded today’s People Power Party. An economist by training, she earned her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Seoul National University and a doctorate from the University of California, Los Angeles.During her parliamentary career, Lee served on the Strategy and Finance Committee and the Special Committee on Budget and Accounts, the latter of which oversees government spending plans.Lee also worked as a research fellow at the state-run Korea Development Institute, adding policy experience to her legislative background.Returning after 12 years since its merger into the Finance Ministry in 2008, the Budget Ministry will be formally launched on Jan. 2, 2026, under the direct supervision of the prime minister.
