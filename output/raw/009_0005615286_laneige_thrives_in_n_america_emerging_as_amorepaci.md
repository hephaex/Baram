# Laneige thrives in N. America, emerging as Amorepacific’s next flagship brand

Amorepacific’s beauty brand Laneige is emerging as a key growth driver for the group, fueled by strong momentum in North America and increasingly rivaling its long-standing flagship brand, Sulwhasoo.According to industry sources on Thursday, Laneige has surfaced as the most likely candidate to become Amorepacific’s next “1-trillion-won ($700 million) brand,” following Sulwhasoo. While Sulwhasoo’s annual revenue has fallen below the 1-trillion-won mark amid a prolonged slowdown in the Chinese market, Laneige has continued to post growth of around 10 percent.Laneige recorded sales of 730 billion won in fiscal 2025, and revenue is projected to rise to around 800 billion won in 2026, industry watchers said.Nearly 90 percent of Laneige’s revenue is generated overseas, underscoring its status as a truly global brand. In particular, the brand has grown rapidly in the Americas and other Western markets on the back of strong performance in lip care and skincare, playing a central role in lifting Amorepacific’s overall overseas sales. Laneige is estimated to account for more than 60 percent of Amorepacific’s revenue in the Americas.According to U.S. consumer data firm Numerator, Laneige posted an average annual sales growth rate exceeding 56 percent in the Americas over the two-year period from July 2022 to June 2024.One of Laneige’s best-selling products is its Lip Sleeping Mask, which sold approximately 20 million units worldwide last year—equivalent to one unit every two seconds. The product also became a holiday-season bestseller at U.S. beauty retailer Sephora, sharply boosting brand recognition.An Amorepacific official said affordable lip products that offer a sense of indulgence during economic downturns have helped drive demand, adding that K-beauty brands are delivering differentiated experiences to global consumers through diverse formulations and distinctive fragrances.
