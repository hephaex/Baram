NewJeans-contract disputeADOR files suit against Danielle, ex-chief Min seeking 43.1 bln won in compensation SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- K-pop label ADOR has filed a suit against Danielle, whom the agency recently terminated their contract with, and former chief executive Min Hee-jin seeking around 43.1 billion won (US$29.7 million) in compensation, legal sources said Tuesday. The case, also filed against a family member of Danielle, has been assigned to a division at the Seoul Central District Court, which formerly oversaw a stock dispute between Min and ADOR&#x27;s parent company, Hybe, according to the sources. The suit comes a day after ADOR said it has delivered notice of contract termination to Danielle, concluding that it would be difficult to work with her as a NewJeans member and as one of its artists. The company said it also filed for a penalty and compensation for damages from Danielle with the Seoul court, though it did not disclose the requested amount. ADOR had also signaled further action, announcing plans to pursue legal responsibility against one of Danielle&#x27;s family members and Min, whom it accuses of playing a key role in triggering the dispute and delaying the group&#x27;s return. NewJeans had previously challenged ADOR, calling for the reinstatement of Min, who was removed from her post in November last year following a bitter power struggle with Hybe. The members later argued that their contracts had already been nullified due to alleged breaches by ADOR, while the label insisted the agreements remained valid and sought court confirmation, as well as an injunction to bar the group from pursuing independent activities. Courts rejected the members&#x27; arguments and backed ADOR in both the injunction proceedings and the main legal case. ADOR said Monday that NewJeans member Hanni will remain with the company, adding she had &quot;chosen to respect the court&#x27;s ruling&quot; and stay on its roster. Following the legal setbacks, members Haerin and Hyein recently expressed their intention to return to the agency, with Hanni, Minji and Danielle later indicating similar positions. ADOR said talks with Minji are ongoing, adding that both sides are engaged in continued discussions aimed at broadening &quot;mutual understanding.&quot;
