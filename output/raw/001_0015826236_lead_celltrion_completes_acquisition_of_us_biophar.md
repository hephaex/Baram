(LEAD) Celltrion-US acquisition (LEAD) Celltrion completes acquisition of U.S. biopharmaceutical plant(ATTN: UPDATES with chairman&#x27;s message in paras 6-8) SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- Celltrion Inc., a major South Korean biopharmaceutical company, has completed the acquisition of a biopharmaceutical manufacturing plant in the United States, the company said Friday, paving the way for local contract manufacturing deals under tariff-free conditions. Celltrion USA Inc., the company&#x27;s U.S. unit, finalized the deal to acquire the 460 billion-won (US$317 million) facility in New Jersey from U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly and Company (LLY), the company said in a press release. Following the acquisition, Celltrion has signed a contract manufacturing organization (CMO) agreement worth 678.7 billion won to produce biopharmaceutical products for Eli Lilly for three years through 2029, it added. &quot;The U.S. acquisition was aimed at proactively responding to rapidly changing biopharmaceutical markets. The company plans to expand the facility to secure additional global CMO contracts,&quot; a company official said.

On Wednesday, Celltrion projected its annual operating profit would exceed 1 trillion won for the first time this year, driven by strong sales of high-margin biosimilar products. In his New Year&#x27;s message, Chairman Seo Jung-jin said the company will use the three-year period through 2028 to pursue innovations aimed at achieving a &quot;quantum leap&quot; in terms of Celltrion&#x27;s business performance. Celltrion said it plans to adopt an artificial intelligence (AI) platform to improve efficiency across its operations, from research and development (R&amp;D) and clinical trials to production and sales. The company also said it will establish business entities in China and India to explore opportunities in biopharmaceuticals and other promising sectors in the countries. Celltrion has been expanding its global biosimilar portfolio, increasing the number of approved products from six to 11. The company aims to commercialize 18 biosimilars by 2030 and 41 by 2038. Its only original drug, Zymfentra, is currently sold in the U.S. to treat autoimmune diseases. The product is marketed as Remsima SC in Europe and other regions.
