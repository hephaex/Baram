police-Coupang Police say Coupang withheld internal evidence analysis over massive data leakBy Chae Yun-hwan SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- E-commerce giant Coupang did not disclose it had internally analyzed a laptop linked to its massive data leak when it handed the device over to police last week, a senior police official said Monday. On Dec. 21, the company submitted the laptop owned by a former employee suspected to be behind the leak but remained silent on its internal analysis during questioning, Park Jeong-bo, head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency, said. &quot;If (Coupang) submitted false or manipulated data and illegal activities are found, (we) plan to hold it gravely accountable,&quot; Park told reporters, describing Coupang&#x27;s actions as &quot;unusual.&quot; He said the exact details of the leak, such as the extent of the compromised data, could be confirmed only after investigators complete analyzing evidence they have secured, including the laptop. Last Thursday, the company said it had identified the former employee responsible for the data leak using forensic evidence, noting the suspect used stolen security keys to access basic customer information from nearly 34 million accounts. Coupang said data from only about 3,000 accounts was actually saved and later deleted by the suspect, adding that it found no evidence that any customer data was shared with or transmitted to third parties.
