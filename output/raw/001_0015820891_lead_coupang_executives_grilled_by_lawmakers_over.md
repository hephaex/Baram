(LEAD) Coupang-data leak (LEAD) Coupang executives grilled by lawmakers over massive data leak, compensation plan(ATTN: UPDATES throughout; CHANGES headline, lead, photo)By Chae Yun-hwan SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- Lawmakers grilled Coupang executives during a parliamentary hearing Tuesday over the online retailer&#x27;s massive data leak that affected nearly two-thirds of South Korea&#x27;s population and its compensation plan that has drawn criticism. The two-day session began earlier in the day to examine the company&#x27;s major breach as well as its alleged unfair practices, with Harold Rogers, interim chief executive of the company&#x27;s Korean unit, facing a barrage of criticism. Lawmakers also took aim at the company&#x27;s compensation plan unveiled the previous day designed to provide 50,000 won (US$35) worth of discounts and coupons to each of the 33.7 million users affected by the breach. Coupang&#x27;s compensation plan has drawn instant criticism because each customer is allowed to spend only 5,000 won at the online retailer&#x27;s main platform, while the remaining vouchers worth 45,000 won could be used at other commerce platforms, including a platform for luxury goods. Critics say such measures may be aimed at prompting customers to spend more at Coupang&#x27;s other platforms. &quot;Not only is it a low-level of compensation, this cheap trick of promotional activities is stoking public outrage,&quot; Rep. Lee Yong-woo of the ruling Democratic Party said.

Rogers defended the compensation plan, citing its voluntary nature and the total amount of nearly 1.7 trillion won. Lawmakers also took issue with Coupang founder Kim Bom-suk&#x27;s absence despite being selected as one of the hearing&#x27;s witnesses. &quot;Chairman Kim who bears final responsibility in the case and effectively controls Coupang did not appear today,&quot; Rep. An Ho-young of the DP said. &quot;This is insolent behavior that disregards the National Assembly and our people.&quot; Last month, Coupang confirmed that the personal information of 33.7 million customer accounts had been exposed, noting the compromised data included users&#x27; names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery addresses. A police investigation into the massive data leak is currently under way.
