# Lee Hye-hoon says Korea faces a ‘gray rhino,’ not a black swan crisis

Lee Hye-hoon, a former lawmaker from the main opposition People Power Party, was named Sunday as the first minister-designate of the newly established Ministry of Planning and Budget, a powerful body tasked with shaping fiscal policy and long-term economic strategy.Lee Hye-hoon, the first minister-designate of the newly established Planning and Budget Office, said on Monday that the South Korean economy is facing a structural and complex crisis that is eroding its growth potential, describing the current situation as a “perfect storm” in the short term.Speaking to reporters while arriving at her temporary office at the Korea Deposit Insurance Corporation in Seoul, Lee said both the economy and society are in a grave situation.Lee pointed to high inflation and a weak won as the two biggest threats to the Korean economy, stressing that the combined burden of rising prices and elevated exchange rates is weighing heavily on households. If inflation and currency weakness persist, she warned, interest rates could rise further, threatening the livelihoods of working-class and middle-class families as well as small merchants and the self-employed. Fragile signs of recovery in domestic demand could also deteriorate into a deeper slowdown.She identified five structural challenges facing the economy: the demographic crisis, climate change, severe polarization, sweeping changes in industry and technology, and the decline of regional communities. These risks, she said, are not “black swans” that emerge unexpectedly, but rather “gray rhinos” — obvious and long-forewarned threats that become devastating when ignored.Lee said the Planning and Budget Office was created precisely because the situation calls for strategic thinking that goes beyond short-term responses. She described the new body as a strategic planning control tower responsible for designing Korea’s future and guiding the country’s long-term direction.Some observers, however, have raised concerns about potential friction between Lee and Koo Yun-cheol, the deputy prime minister for economic affairs, who oversees overall economic policymaking. Although taxation and budgeting have been institutionally separated, analysts say coordination challenges could arise during the implementation of major economic policies.Lee also emphasized the importance of efficient fiscal management, calling for unnecessary spending to be eliminated while bold investments are made in areas that directly support livelihoods and economic growth. She said the government will continue to concentrate fiscal resources on sectors capable of delivering tangible growth outcomes.Lee’s nomination has also renewed political attention on the so-called “Seoul National University class of 1982.” Within the current cabinet, Prime Minister Kim Min-seok and Deputy Prime Minister Koo are both alumni from that cohort. If confirmed, Lee would join them, placing two key economic policy posts in the hands of officials from the same class. In the People Power Party, floor leader Song Eon-seog and lawmaker Na Kyung-won are also prominent members of the group, as is Cho Kuk, head of the Cho Kuk Innovation Party.
