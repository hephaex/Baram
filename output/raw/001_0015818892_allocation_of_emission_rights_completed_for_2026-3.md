emission rights-allocation Allocation of emission rights completed for 2026-30 period SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- The government has allocated 2.36 billion tons of greenhouse gas emission rights, which can be traded from next year until 2030, to 772 companies, the Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment said Monday. The latest allocation was completed on the day for the 772 firms participating in the fourth planning period (2026-2030), the ministry said. The greenhouse gas emissions trading system sets a cap on total emissions for major polluters, issues tradable &quot;allowances&quot; and lets companies buy or sell these allowances to meet target. The goal is to encourage greenhouse gas emissions reductions through market principles. The total allowable emissions for the fourth planning period are 2.36 billion tons, which represent a 17.91 percent decrease compared to the 2.88 billion tons allowed during the third planning period (2021-2025), the ministry noted. In the power generation sector, 796 million tons were allocated to 59 companies. In the non-power generation sector, 1.57 billion tons were distributed to 713 companies.
