govt-MSCI roadmap Gov&#x27;t to announce road map for Seoul&#x27;s inclusion in global index MSCI early next year SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- The government will unveil a comprehensive road map early next year aimed at ensuring South Korea&#x27;s inclusion in the developed market index of global index provider Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), a ranking finance ministry official said Tuesday. First Vice Finance Minister Lee Hyoung-il made the remarks while presiding over a government-wide task force meeting focused on the inclusion, as well as plans to improve foreign investors&#x27; access to the country&#x27;s equity and currency markets. Officials from the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the Bank of Korea, the Financial Services Commission and the Financial Supervisory Service attended the meeting. The government is seeking to boost foreign investment through measures such as inclusion in the MSCI developed market index as part of a broader push to revitalize the stock market and usher in what it calls the &quot;KOSPI 5,000 era,&quot; referring to the benchmark Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI). Earlier this year, MSCI kept South Korea in its emerging market group, citing the limited convertibility of the Korean won in offshore currency markets as a key barrier to its reclassification as a developed market and inclusion in the global index.
