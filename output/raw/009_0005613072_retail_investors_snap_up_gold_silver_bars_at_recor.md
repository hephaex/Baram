# Retail investors snap up gold, silver bars at record pace

South Korean retail investors sharply increased investments in safe-haven assets such as gold, silver and the U.S. dollar this year, driven by uncertainty over global trade conditions and interest-rate paths at home and abroad, even as abundant liquidity pushed up prices across most asset classes.Surging international prices for gold and silver also fueled demand. Gold prices have risen roughly 70 percent year to date, while silver has jumped more than 150 percent, putting both metals on track for their strongest annual gains since 1979.According to sources on Sunday, sales of gold bars at Korea’s five major banks—KB Kookmin Bank, Shinhan Bank, Hana Bank, Woori Bank and NH NongHyup Bank—reached 677.9 billion won ($471 million) from January through Dec. 24. This marks the highest level since records began in 2020 and is more than four times the full-year total recorded in 2024.Excluding NH NongHyup Bank, which does not disclose sales volumes, the remaining four banks sold a combined 3,745 kilograms of gold bars, a record figure that is 2.7 times higher than a year earlier.Silver bars also saw a shortage as prices soared. Among the four banks that sell silver bars—excluding Hana Bank—sales totaled 30.6 billion won, the highest level on record and roughly 38 times last year’s 790 million won.“While it is difficult to precisely categorize buyers, most gold and silver bar purchases should be attributed to individual investors,” said an official at a commercial bank. “In my entire career, I’ve never seen retail demand for gold and silver at this scale.”Gold-linked savings products also posted record performance. Shinhan Bank’s “Gold Rich” accounts totaled 187,859 accounts with combined balances of nearly 1.3 trillion won, the highest since the product’s launch in 2003. The balance is 2.4 times larger than at the end of last year.

The won’s weakness—hovering in the 1,400-won-per-dollar range for most of the year—also drew attention to the dollar as an alternative investment. As of Dec. 24, individual dollar deposit balances at the five major banks reached $12.73 billion, up $917 million from the end of last year.On Dec. 24, after a verbal intervention by currency authorities sent the exchange rate down more than 30 won, one Hana Bank branch in Seoul’s Gangnam area even ran out of $100 bills as retail investors rushed to exchange won for dollars. “In the past, a falling exchange rate mainly reassured households with overseas students,” a bank official said. “These days, individuals are actively buying dollars as part of their investment portfolios.”Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, spot gold prices stood at $4,508.15 per ounce at 2:20 p.m. on Dec. 26. Gold futures for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 0.8 percent to $4,539.20. Spot silver climbed 2.9 percent to $74.68, briefly hitting $75.15 during intraday trading to break above the $75 mark for the first time.
