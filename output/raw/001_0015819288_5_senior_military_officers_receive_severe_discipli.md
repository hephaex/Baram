martial law-disciplinary action5 senior military officers receive &#x27;severe&#x27; disciplinary action over martial law involvement SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) —- The defense ministry said Monday it has decided to take &quot;severe&quot; disciplinary action against five senior Army officers for their involvement in former President Yoon Suk Yeol&#x27;s failed bid to impose martial law last year. The decision came after the ministry held a committee meeting earlier this month to decide on disciplinary action against eight senior Army officers -- seven generals and one colonel -- involved in the martial law bid on Dec. 3 last year. The ministry said it imposed serious disciplinary action on Yeo In-hyung, former head of the Defense Counterintelligence Command; Lee Jin-woo, former chief of the Capital Defense Command; and Kwak Jong-keun, former commander of the Army Special Warfare Command. The three are currently on trial on charges of playing key roles in an insurrection for allegedly deploying troops to the National Assembly and the National Election Commission on the night martial law was declared. Yeo and Lee are believed to face removal from office, the toughest level of disciplinary action. Kwak is said to face dismissal, the second-highest level of punishment imposed, in consideration of his efforts to help restore constitutional order and uncover the truth behind the martial law through testimonies at Yoon&#x27;s trials. Meanwhile, a former Army vice chief of staff was also reportedly handed the second-highest level of disciplinary action, while a colonel with the Defense Counterintelligence Command was given a two-month suspension.
