(LEAD) Lee-China(LEAD) Lee, China&#x27;s Xi to discuss peace, denuclearization on Korean Peninsula at Monday summit in Beijing (ATTN: UPDATES throughout with details; CHANGES headline, photos) By Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Jae Myung and Chinese President Xi Jinping plan to discuss peace and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula as the leaders were set to hold summit talks next week in Beijing, National Security Adviser Wi Sung-lac said Friday. Lee is scheduled to pay a four-day state visit to China beginning Sunday amid media reports that he may visit Japan later this month for summit talks with Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi. Asked about the agenda of summit talks between Lee and Xi on Monday, Wi replied, &quot;There will be discussions on peace and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.&quot; The state visit comes less than two months after Xi made his first trip to South Korea in 11 years on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Gyeongju, marking reciprocal state visits within an unusually short period of time.

The two leaders are also expected to discuss practical cooperation in areas that include supply-chain investments, the digital economy, the environment and climate change, people-to-people exchanges, tourism and responses to transnational crimes, Wi told reporters. &quot;South Korea and China share the common goal of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia,&quot; he said. Regarding China&#x27;s raising concerns over South Korea&#x27;s push to develop nuclear-powered submarines, Wi said Seoul will explain its position on the need to build capabilities to counter North Korea&#x27;s evolving threats after Pyongyang recently unveiled a new nuclear-powered submarine that could carry nuclear weapons. &quot;There is a need to respond to the changing security environment,&quot; he said. &quot;We must track and prepare for North Korea&#x27;s nuclear-powered submarines.&quot;

Asked about South Korea&#x27;s stance on Taiwan issues, Wi said, &quot;We respect the one-China policy and will act in accordance with that position.&quot; Lee&#x27;s upcoming visit comes amid heightened tensions around the Taiwan Strait after Beijing conducted large-scale military drills near the self-ruled island earlier this week. During a phone call with Foreign Minister Cho Hyun on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Seoul to take a &quot;responsible&quot; approach to history and to adhere to the one-China principle on the Taiwan issue.

Cultural exchanges will also be discussed as Seoul seeks to expand access to Korean content in China, which has faced unofficial restrictions since the 2017 deployment of a U.S.-led missile defense system in South Korea. &quot;Although China officially does not acknowledge a ban on Korean content, we view the situation differently,&quot; Wi said. &quot;We will seek to address the issue by expanding cultural exchanges.&quot; Sensitive matters are also likely to be raised, including China&#x27;s construction of steel structures in the overlapping sea zone in the Yellow Sea, which Seoul sees as potentially laying the groundwork for territorial claims. Wi said the two sides have already held working-level talks on China&#x27;s maritime structure after it was raised during Lee&#x27;s November summit with Xi and will continue efforts to make progress. Lee is also expected to use the visit to deepen economic ties with China, South Korea&#x27;s largest trading partner. Accompanied by a large business delegation, Lee will meet business leaders from both countries at an economic forum in Beijing on Monday. On Tuesday, Lee is scheduled to have a luncheon meeting with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, who is in charge of economic policy, and meet with Zhao Leji, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, China&#x27;s top legislator. In Shanghai, Lee plans to visit the historic site that once housed the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea during Japan&#x27;s colonial rule to mark the centennial anniversary of its establishment. He will also commemorate the 150th anniversary of the birth of independence hero Kim Gu (1876-1949), who led the provisional government in Shanghai. Lee&#x27;s visit to the site aims to honor the sacrifices of independence activists and recall the history of South Korea and China working together to restore sovereignty from Japanese rule, Wi said. ejkim@yna.co.kr(END)
