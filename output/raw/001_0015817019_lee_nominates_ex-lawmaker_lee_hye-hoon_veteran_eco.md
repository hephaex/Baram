Lee-budget minister Lee nominates ex-lawmaker Lee Hye-hoon, veteran economist, as new minister for planning and budget SEOUL, Dec. 28 (Yonhap) - President Lee Jae Myung has nominated Lee Hye-hoon, a veteran economist and former three-term lawmaker from the conservative camp, as the new minister for planning and budget, the presidential office said Sunday. The nominee was tapped as the inaugural head of the Ministry of Planning and Budget, which will be installed under the prime minister&#x27;s office as part of a government reorganization bill set to take effect in January, Lee Kyu-yeon, presidential secretary for public relations and communication, said at a briefing. The nominee previously served three terms in the National Assembly in the conservative bloc and ran on the main opposition People Power Party&#x27;s ticket in the April 2024 parliamentary elections.
