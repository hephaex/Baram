Ministry issues &#x27;Yellow Envelope Act&#x27; guidelines; further refinement neededLast week, the Ministry of Employment and Labor released interpretive guidelines for the revised Trade Union and Labor Relations Act, commonly known as the Yellow Envelope Act.Although presented as a way to prevent confusion in workplaces, the guidelines are broad and vague, heightening concerns that disputes over key provisions will inevitably be litigated.Fundamentally, the guidelines contain inherent flaws. The Yellow Envelope Act itself ambiguously broadens the definition of “employer” to encompass “those who can substantially and concretely determine working conditions.”Under the guidelines, employer status hinges on whether a contractor exercises “structural control” over working conditions.If a contractor effectively exerts structural control over a subcontractor’s manpower management, working hours, work methods, industrial safety and related matters, the subcontractor’s employees would be entitled to bargain collectively with the contractor. In such cases, the contractor’s chief executive — rather than the subcontractor’s — would be treated as the employer of those workers.The guidelines also state that whether a contractor is required to bargain with subcontractors should be determined on an issue-by-issue basis related to working conditions. However, they provide no specific examples. Further clarification on the conditions that trigger bargaining obligations is needed.In practice, “structural control” is no clearer than the already vague notion of “substantial and concrete control.” So, the scenario contractors fear — being forced to negotiate individually with unions representing hundreds or even thousands of subcontractors — remains unchanged.By suggesting that control over industrial safety and health systems may incur employer status, the guidelines effectively imply that complying with the Occupational Safety and Health Act could itself expose contractors to being deemed employers and dragged into strikes. This outcome appears unreasonable.The guidelines state that management decisions such as overseas investment, mergers, spin-offs, sales and transfers are not subject to collective bargaining demands by trade unions. Yet they add that if those decisions are objectively expected to trigger layoffs or workforce reshuffles, trade unions may seek collective bargaining.The problem is that corporate decisions such as overseas moves, sales and mergers are almost certain to affect work methods in some way. As a result, strategic business judgments could become grounds for lawful strikes.If the guidelines take effect as written, companies seeking to move factories overseas to survive worsening domestic conditions or to sell parts of their businesses are likely to find themselves forced to seek prior consent from trade unions.If business decisions on investment or restructuring become subject to collective bargaining and strikes, companies will struggle to adapt to a rapidly changing industrial environment.It could also undermine the ongoing restructuring of the nation’s petrochemical industry. There are concerns that even subcontractor unions could resort to strikes to contest the strategic judgments of large companies.The Yellow Envelope Act is all but certain to fuel labor-management conflicts, as it opens the door wide for subcontractor unions to strike against large contractors with whom they have no employment contracts.Labor disputes bear directly on national competitiveness. If subcontractor strikes become frequent in Korea’s key industries such as automobiles, shipbuilding and steel, the erosion of the country’s industrial competitiveness would be inevitable.The Yellow Envelope Act is set to take effect on March 10 next year. With roughly 70 days left, the government must further streamline related regulations and guidelines to minimize workplace confusion from the start.Given the controversy surrounding the revised act and its untested nature in Korea, confusion and conflict appear inevitable to some extent. With enforcement fixed, the country can only wait and see how it plays out.If the law is found to seriously damage the national economy, legislators will need to supplement or revise it. Rolling back expanded workers&#x27; rights may be difficult, but what must be done should not be avoided.
