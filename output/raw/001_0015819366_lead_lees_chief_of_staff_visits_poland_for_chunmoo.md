(LEAD) presidential aide-arms exports(LEAD) Lee&#x27;s chief of staff visits Poland for Chunmoo export deal signing(ATTN: UPDATES with latest details; CHANGES headline, lead)By Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Jae Myung&#x27;s chief of staff is visiting Poland to attend a signing ceremony, Cheong Wa Dae said Monday, as the European country is set to seal a major arms deal for South Korea&#x27;s Chunmoo multiple launch rocket system. Kang Hoon-sik traveled to Poland as the presidential envoy for strategic economic cooperation on a three-day trip to attend the ceremony and is scheduled to return Tuesday, the office said in a press notice. Hanwha Aerospace said Monday it will sign a third-stage contract with Poland&#x27;s arms procurement agency in Warsaw to export the Chunmoo system in a deal worth 5.6 trillion won (US$3.9 billion). The latest agreement builds on two previous deals signed in 2022 and 2024, with the first valued at 5.03 trillion won and the second at 2.2 trillion won. Kang&#x27;s latest trip follows his earlier visits to Poland, Romania and Norway in October and to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia in November. During those trips, he focused on expanding cooperation in the defense industry and supporting Korean companies seeking overseas contracts. Kang was appointed as Lee&#x27;s special envoy in October to help carry out the administration&#x27;s goal of positioning South Korea as one of the world&#x27;s four largest arms exporters. The office said Kang plans to undertake such missions on three occasions through the first half of next year.
