# How Samsung froze Galaxy prices while adding features

Samsung Electronics’ decision to keep prices unchanged for its upcoming Galaxy flagship lineup reflects a two-track strategy aimed at defending both market share and profitability, despite mounting cost pressures.Samsung plans to hold prices steady for the Galaxy S26 series, scheduled for release in March, as well as its foldable lineup set to launch in July. The move comes even as rising component costs and a weaker won have made price increases appear inevitable.Industry watchers had widely expected Samsung to raise prices on its flagship models. Global market research firm Counterpoint Research forecasts that smartphone manufacturing costs will rise by 10–15 percent, pushing the average selling price (ASP) of smartphones up by 6.9 percent this year, driven by higher prices for key components such as memory chips, mobile application processors and camera modules.Mobile DRAM prices, particularly LPDDR5, have climbed by double-digit percentages since early last year, significantly increasing cost burdens for smartphone makers. Industry estimates suggest mobile DRAM prices rose by around 15 percent in the third quarter of last year. Prices for mobile APs used in Samsung’s Device Experience (DX) division rose by about 9 percent year-on-year, while camera module prices increased by roughly 3 percent.Moves by rivals have also shaped Samsung’s decision. Apple opted to maintain base prices when launching its iPhone 17 series, reinforcing the importance of price competitiveness in the premium smartphone segment. Chinese rival Xiaomi recently raised prices on some models but has sought to mitigate backlash through temporary discount campaigns.An industry official said that even if component costs rise, pushing higher prices onto consumers risks weakening demand for premium smartphones. “Maintaining price levels while readjusting specifications and cost structures is seen as a more effective way to retain customers,” the official said.Samsung will hold its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Francisco on Feb. 25 (local time) before officially launching the Galaxy S26 series in March. Market attention is focused on whether Samsung can enhance specifications while restructuring costs.The Galaxy S26 base model is expected to see its battery capacity increased from 4,000 milliampere-hours (mAh) to 4,300 mAh. The S26 Plus is rumored to support enhanced 3x zoom HDR photography, while the S26 Ultra may feature a “privacy display” that limits side viewing angles through independently driven pixels.In the foldable lineup, Samsung plans to reduce the weight of the Galaxy Fold 8 from 215 grams to the 200-gram range while boosting battery capacity from 4,400 mAh to 5,000 mAh. The Galaxy Flip 8 is expected to shed weight from 188 grams to around 150 grams to emphasize portability.While flagship prices will remain frozen, Samsung is expected to slightly raise prices for some models in its budget-friendly Galaxy A series. The Galaxy A57 5G is reportedly set at $499, the A36 5G at $389, and the A07 5G at $159, reflecting a strategy to protect margins while sustaining market share.
