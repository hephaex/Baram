foreigners-illegal property dealsGov&#x27;t probe finds 88 suspicious property deals involving foreigners SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- The government has uncovered 88 suspected cases of illegal property transactions involving foreign nationals in a special probe on non-housing real estate deals, officials said Tuesday. In the investigation carried out jointly by the land ministry and the Office for Government Policy Coordination from September through last week, the authorities found 126 suspected illegal acts tied to 88 transactions reported between July 2024 and July of this year. The cases mostly involved deals tied to &quot;officetels,&quot; or multipurpose buildings with residential and commercial units, and land. Suspected violations include illegal inflows of overseas funds, unauthorized rental operations by foreigners who lack proper residency status and misuse of bank loans. Officials have referred the cases to multiple authorities, including the justice ministry, the Financial Services Commission and the National Tax Service, for follow-up measures. The latest findings follow an earlier probe into housing transactions involving foreigners, during which 210 suspected illegal deals were identified. The land ministry said it plans to continue intensive monitoring of foreign real estate transactions next year while stepping up on-site inspections to root out illegal transactions.
