Myanmar holds general electionsA handout photo made available by the Myanmar Military Information Team shows Myanmar military chief Senior General Min Aung Hlaing displaying his ink-marked little finger after casting a ballot during the general election in Naypyitaw, Myanmar, 28 December 2025. Myanmar&#x27;s military government, known as the State Administration Council (SAC), plans to hold its first national vote since the February 2021 coup in a multi-stage general election, with the first phase set for 28 December 2025, and the second for 11 January 2026. Over 50 political parties have registered to participate in the election, according to the Union Election Commission (UEC), while the main pro-democracy opposition, the National League for Democracy (NLD), has been dissolved since March 2023.
