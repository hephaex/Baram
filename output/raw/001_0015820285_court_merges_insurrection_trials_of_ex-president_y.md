court-insurrection trials Court merges insurrection trials of ex-President Yoon, ex-defense, police chiefs SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- A Seoul court on Tuesday combined the insurrection trials of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, former Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun and former police chief Cho Ji-ho over their involvement in last year&#x27;s failed martial law bid into a single trial. The announcement came during Yoon&#x27;s trial hearing on charges of leading an insurrection at the Seoul Central District Court, which had been conducted separately from the trials of former military and defense officials, including Kim, and of Cho and other police leadership. The court bench had earlier said it would merge the three trials as they deal with identical facts and have the same points of contention over charges of insurrection. Six of the eight defendants of the three trials were present at the courtroom, including Yoon, the former defense chief and Kim Bong-sik, former head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. The bench plans to conduct witness examination on the former defense minister during Tuesday&#x27;s trial before carrying out evidence examination next week.
