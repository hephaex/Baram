(LEAD) Coupang founder-data leak (LEAD) Coupang founder issues 1st apology since massive data leak (ATTN: ADDS remarks, details; RECASTS headline, lead para)By Kang Jae-eun SEOUL, Dec. 28 (Yonhap) -- The founder of e-commerce giant Coupang Inc., Kim Bom-suk, on Sunday apologized for a massive data breach, marking his first formal apology since the leak of personal information that affected nearly two-thirds of the population in South Korea. &quot;As the founder and the chairman of the board, I sincerely apologize on behalf of all the employees at Coupang,&quot; Kim was quoted as saying in a written statement issued by the company. &quot;I have caused huge frustration and disappointment by failing to communicate clearly since the onset of the incident. I sincerely apologize for my inadequate initial response and the lack of communication,&quot; the statement read. Kim said he admits that his apology came later than expected. This was because he had originally intended to issue an official apology once &quot;all facts were confirmed,&quot; but such an idea was a &quot;wrong judgment,&quot; he added. Kim&#x27;s apology came about a month since the personal information of about 34 million customers of Coupang was leaked in South Korea. It also came after Coupang said it had identified the former employee responsible for the data leak using forensic evidence, recovered the equipment used in the hacking and received a confession from the hacker. The government, however, has called Coupang&#x27;s investigation results a &quot;unilateral claim,&quot; saying that a joint public-private investigation on the incident has yet to release any findings. Kim again sent a statement of his non-appearance at a parliamentary hearing this week over the massive data breach, citing his &quot;prearranged schedule.&quot;
