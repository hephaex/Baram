celebrity couple-donation Hyun Bin, Son Ye-jin donate 200 mln won to Samsung Medical Center SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin, both actors, donated 200 million won (US$139,000) to a Seoul hospital to support patients in need, Hyun Bin&#x27;s agency said Tuesday. The donation to Samsung Medical Center will be used to help patients facing financial difficulties, according to VAST Entertainment. The couple expressed hope that the donation &quot;would be helpful, even in the slightest bit, to patients and their families.&quot; This marks the couple&#x27;s latest charitable contribution. They previously donated 150 million won each to Seoul Asan Medical Center and Samsung Medical Center, respectively, to support pediatric patients&#x27; treatment. In November, Hyun Bin won the best actor award at the 46th Blue Dragon Awards for his portrayal of independence fighter Ahn Jung-geun (1879-1910) in the period drama &quot;Harbin.&quot; His wife, Son, was named Best Actress at the same ceremony for her role in Park Chan-wook&#x27;s &quot;No Other Choice.&quot;
