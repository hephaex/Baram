Lee-Cheong Wa Dae Lee set to spend first official day at Cheong Wa Dae after relocation SEOUL, Dec. 28 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Jae Myung will mark his first official day at Cheong Wa Dae early this week after the presidential office was relocated back to the former presidential compound in central Seoul, officials said Sunday. Lee will begin work at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday, with the symbolic presidential flag bearing two phoenixes to be raised at the compound early Monday morning, the presidential office said. It marks the first time the presidential office has moved back to Cheong Wa Dae since former President Yoon Suk Yeol relocated it to the defense ministry compound in May 2022.

The official name of the presidential office will also revert to Cheong Wa Dae, while Lee&#x27;s main workspace will be located in the Yeomin building complex instead of the main presidential building. The Yeomin building complex houses the offices of presidential staff, and Lee&#x27;s presence there is expected to facilitate closer communications with officials. The main building, known for its iconic blue roof and located about 500 meters from the office complex, will mainly be used for formal occasions, such as summits and credential ceremonies.
