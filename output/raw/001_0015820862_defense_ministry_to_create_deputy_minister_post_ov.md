defense ministry-overhaulDefense ministry to create deputy minister post overseeing AI policy SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- The defense ministry will create the post of deputy minister in charge of artificial intelligence (AI)-related affairs this week in an effort to better build a smart military, officials said Tuesday. The reform plan, which was approved at a Cabinet meeting earlier in the day, is aimed at transforming the military into a force that adopts cutting-edge technologies, the ministry said. Under the plan, the ministry will abolish the office of military resource management and establish a new deputy minister in charge of all AI-related functions, including logistics, information and military assets. Won Jong-dae, head of the office of military resource management, will take on the role as the new deputy minister, according to ministry officials. The deputy minister will oversee four bureaus concerned with AI tasks, comprising around 220 personnel. The post of deputy defense minister will be revived for the first time since 2006. The organizational overhaul is set to take effect Friday.
