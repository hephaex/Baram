SPC-LAFC partnershipParis Baguette to launch LAFC-themed products in 3rd global sports partnership SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- SPC Group, a major South Korean food and beverage company, said Tuesday its bakery brand Paris Baguette will launch products themed around Los Angeles Football Club (LAFC) of the U.S. Major League Soccer (MLS). Under the recently signed partnership, new products inspired by the &quot;Heung-Bu Duo&quot; -- Son Heung-min and Denis Bouanga -- will be released in global markets starting next year, SPC said in a press release. Paris Baguette&#x27;s partnership with LAFC marks the first such collaboration between a South Korean food and dining company and a U.S.-based sports team. &quot;Through our partnership with LAFC, we will roll out a variety of initiatives that allow customers to share meaningful stories and special experiences, alongside our bread,&quot; said Hur Jin-soo, president and chief executive officer (CEO) of SPC Group. LAFC is a Los Angeles-based club that made its MLS debut in 2018 and currently features star players that include Son, Bouanga and Hugo Lloris. The latest agreement marks SPC&#x27;s third global sports partnership, following collaborations with France&#x27;s Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in 2023–2024 and England&#x27;s Tottenham Hotspur in 2025. Since 2004, SPC has expanded the Paris Baguette brand to 15 countries. The number of its overseas outlets has recently surpassed 700, while its domestic store count stands at around 3,400.
