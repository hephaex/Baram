South Korea’s stock market set a new all-time intraday high on the first trading day of 2026 on Friday.The benchmark Kospi stood at 4,229.57 as of 10:02 a.m., up 0.37 percent from the previous session. The previous intraday record was 4,226.75 set on November 4, 2025. The index surpassed that level as soon as trading for the New Year began.The Kospi opened at 4,224.53 on Friday, up 0.25 percent, and has since been adjusting its gains.The stock market opened one hour later than usual at 10 a.m. due to the annual securities market opening ceremony. The closing time remains unchanged.The Kospi was led by chip stocks.Shares of Samsung Electronics Co. and SK hynix Inc. hit an intraday high on Friday.Samsung Electronics shares were trading at 123,500 won ($85.7) as of 10:34 a.m., up 3 percent from the previous session, reaching a new 52-week high.SK hynix shares rose to a new all-time high of 662,000 won during the day before falling modestly by 0.61 percent to 655,000 won.The simultaneous rise of the two stocks is interpreted as being driven by expectations that the semiconductor industry boom will continue this year, following record-high semiconductor exports in December 2025.Chip exports rose 22.2 percent on year to $173.4 billion in December, setting a new all-time high for the second straight year.“The semiconductor industry is expected to see a full-fledged shift in sentiment starting early in the year,” said Ko Young-min, an analyst at Daol Investment &amp; Securities Co. “With short-term concerns already sufficiently reflected in prices, strong data points from the memory sector could once again serve as catalysts to rebuild market expectations.”Separately, shares of biopharmaceutical giant Celltrion Inc. were trading at 195,100 won as of 10:14 a.m., up 7.79 percent from the previous session.The rally appears to be driven by expectations that the company will post its strongest-ever quarterly performance in the fourth quarter of 2025.On Wednesday, Celltrion announced that it expects fourth-quarter revenue of 1.28 trillion won and operating profit of 472.2 billion won. Revenue is projected to rise 20.7 percent and operating profit to jump 140.4 percent, marking record-high quarterly results.Market sentiment was further lifted by the news that Celltrion completed the relocation of Eli Lilly and Company’s biopharmaceutical production facility in New Jersey, the United States, on the last day of 2025.Major brokerages raised their price targets for Celltrion following the guidance.Samsung Securities Co. raised its target to 230,000 won, citing solidifying U.S. market share and recovered profitability. Eugene Investment &amp; Securities Co. set a target of 250,000 won, forecasting an earnings surprise driven by a favorable product mix and disciplined cost controls.
