Paris Baguette, a major bakery chain owned by South Korea’s SPC Group, and Tous les Jours, a bakery franchise owned by CJ Foodville Co., are gaining popularity in the United States, with their annual sales expected to rise by about 25 percent this year.According to industry sources on Monday, strong performance in the U.S. market could lift the combined annual sales of Paris Baguette and Tous les Jours in the U.S. to over 1 trillion won ($696.5 million) by 2027.Their combined U.S. sales stood at only about 170 billion won in 2020, but surged to 587.3 billion won in 2024. This year, sales are estimated to reach 785 billion won, up 34 percent on year, representing roughly 362 percent growth in five years.Paris Baguette’s U.S. sales are expected to increase to about 585 billion won this year from 132.6 billion won in 2020, while Tous les Jours’ sales are projected to rise to about 200 billion won from 37.3 billion won over the same period. Of Paris Baguette’s approximately 700 overseas outlets, about 260 are in North America. Tous les Jours operates roughly 580 stores globally, including about 190 in North America.Paris Baguette has built a broad U.S. footprint, anchored by West Coast hubs near Silicon Valley and in Los Angeles, San Diego, and Las Vegas, as well as an East Coast corridor stretching from New York and New Jersey to Boston.The chain is also expanding into additional states such as Florida and Kansas as it widens its national presence.Tous les Jours continues to add locations across the U.S., including in New York and Hawaii. More than 90 percent of its U.S. business operates under a franchise model, with the number of multi-unit franchisees growing rapidly. A Madison Square Park store that opened in Manhattan this month is expected to serve as a flagship location to boost brand recognition and showcase product quality.Industry analysts attribute the success of Korean bakery brands in the U.S. to localized product offerings combined with Korean-style breads positioned as desserts, along with pricing that is about 15 to 25 percent lower than comparable local bakery items.To sustain momentum, both brands plan aggressive expansion next year.Paris Baguette aims to open more than 90 stores in the U.S., while Tous les Jours plans to add 80 to 100 locations. Paris Baguette also plans to expand its Canadian network to about 100 stores by 2030.Tous les Jours, in the meantime, will begin full-scale operations next month at its production facility in Georgia, significantly boosting supply capacity.The roughly 90,000-square-meter plant will be capable of producing more than 100 million units annually, including frozen dough and cakes, supporting accelerated store expansion in the U.S., which CJ Group has identified as a core strategic market.“The facility could enable the brand to add close to 300 stores next year,” said an official from Tous les Jours.Paris Baguette is also strengthening its presence in Southeast Asia. The company recently completed construction of a baking facility at the Nusajaya Tech Park in Johor, Malaysia, as part of its push into the halal food market.
