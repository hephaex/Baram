(3rd LD) Coupang-compensation(3rd LD) Coupang unveils nearly 1.69 tln-won compensation plan over data breach(ATTN: UPDATES with gov&#x27;t response meeting in last 6 paras) SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- E-commerce giant Coupang Inc. announced a compensation plan worth more than 1.68 trillion won (US$1.17 billion) Monday following a massive personal data breach. The compensation plan comes a day after Coupang founder Kim Bom-suk issued his first public apology since the incident, which affected nearly two-thirds of South Korea&#x27;s population. Under the plan, the U.S.-listed company will provide 50,000 won worth of discounts and coupons to each of 33.7 million customers, including paid Coupang Wow members, regular users and former customers who have closed their accounts, the company said in a press release. Compensation payments will be made gradually starting Jan. 15, it added. &quot;Taking this incident as a turning point, Coupang will wholeheartedly embrace customer-centric principles and fulfill its responsibilities to the very end, transforming into a company that customers can trust,&quot; Coupang&#x27;s interim Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Harold Rogers said in the release.

The per-person compensation consists of 5,000 won for Coupang&#x27;s e-commerce platform, 5,000 won for food delivery service Coupang Eats, 20,000 won for Coupang&#x27;s travel products, and 20,000 won for R.LUX luxury beauty and fashion products. In response, consumer rights groups said they refused to accept the payment plan, arguing that it makes a mockery of consumers. &quot;The plan is aimed at playing down a grave incident in which a former Coupang employee may have accessed the personal information of 33.7 million Coupang users and at recasting the incident as a promotional event to appease public opinion,&quot; the Korea National Council of Consumer Operations said in a statement. Describing the 50,000-won compensation per user as nothing more than a marketing strategy designed to encourage additional purchases and renewed membership, the council called on the government to conduct a thorough investigation and take strict administrative action against Coupang. Last week, Coupang said it had identified a former employee responsible for the data leak through forensic evidence, recovered the equipment used in the hacking and received a confession from the suspect. The company claimed that data from only about 3,000 accounts was actually saved and later deleted by the suspect. The government, however, has dismissed Coupang&#x27;s findings as a &quot;unilateral claim,&quot; noting that a joint public-private investigation into the incident has yet to release any conclusions. On Nov. 29, Coupang confirmed that the personal information of 33.7 million customer accounts had been exposed, far exceeding the 4,500 accounts initially reported to authorities on Nov. 20. Given that active users of Coupang&#x27;s product commerce division, including its delivery service, reached 24.7 million in the third quarter, the scale of the breach suggests that nearly the entire user base may have been affected. The company said the compromised data included users&#x27; names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery addresses. An interagency government task force (TF) on the case, meanwhile, held a meeting, vowing to take &quot;omnidirectional and comprehensive&quot; measures against the incident, according to the Ministry of Science and ICT. The TF, chaired by Science Minister Bae Kyung-hoon, comprises officials from the science and labor ministries, as well as the media watchdog, financial authorities, the police and the intelligence agency. &quot;The government views the incident not just as an internal corporate problem, but as a grave case directly linked to privacy, platform responsibility, workers&#x27; safety, fair trade and compliance in the logistics and retail sectors,&quot; the ministry said in a release. During the meeting, the Korea Fair Trade Commission said it will consider whether to impose a business suspension on Coupang by taking into account damages among customers and the company&#x27;s efforts to make compensation. Separately, the labor ministry plans to look into measures of Coupang in connection with labor conditions of workers during late-night, early-morning delivery operations. &quot;The government will work as one team to take proactive measures, reassure the public and leave no suspicion behind,&quot; Bae said.
