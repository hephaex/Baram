finance ministry-reorganization Finance ministry divided into 2 bodies in gov&#x27;t reorganization SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- The finance ministry was formally divided into two separate ministries on Friday, with a newly established body taking over the government&#x27;s budget planning functions. Under a government reorganization, the ministry was divided into the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the newly established Ministry of Planning and Budget, which has been placed under the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office. The reorganization comes nearly 18 years after the current system was launched in 2008 under the previous Lee Myung-bak administration, when the two ministries were merged. &quot;Facing us now are goals that must be achieved, including a rebound in potential growth and making this year the starting point for a major economic leap forward,&quot; Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol said during an opening ceremony at the ministry. Lee Hye-hoon, a former three-term lawmaker from the conservative bloc, has been nominated to head the newly created ministry.
