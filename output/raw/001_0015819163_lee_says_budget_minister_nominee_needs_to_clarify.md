Lee-budget minister nomineeLee says budget minister nominee needs to clarify remarks over ex-President Yoon&#x27;s martial law bidBy Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Jae Myung said Monday that his nominee for budget minister needs to clarify her remarks in support of former President Yoon Suk Yeol&#x27;s failed martial law bid, a presidential spokesperson said. Lee Hye-hoon, a former three-term lawmaker from the conservative camp and a veteran economist, was named Sunday as the first minister of the soon-to-be-launched Ministry of Planning and Budget. The choice came as a surprise, as she had previously made comments supporting Yoon&#x27;s martial law attempt, taken part in rallies opposing his impeachment, and spoken out against President Lee&#x27;s push for expansionary fiscal policy and cash handout programs. Addressing the controversy, President Lee said the nominee should clarify her position on her past remarks about Yoon&#x27;s martial law and make it clear that she intends to sever ties with those issues, presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung told reporters.

President Lee also emphasized the importance of resolving differences through dialogue in order to craft better policies. &quot;It is necessary to coordinate differing views and come up with better ideas through the process,&quot; he was quoted as saying. Her nomination will go through a parliamentary confirmation hearing, although the president can proceed with the appointment regardless of the outcome. The pick has also drawn a strong backlash from the main opposition People Power Party, which ousted Lee from the party shortly after Sunday&#x27;s announcement, accusing her of accepting the post while still serving as chair of a party constituency committee in Seoul. The new budget ministry will be placed under the prime minister&#x27;s office as part of a government reorganization bill set to take effect in January. Under the new structure, the Ministry of Finance and Economy will serve as the government&#x27;s policy control tower, while the newly created ministry will handle budget allocation and mid- to long-term economic strategy.
