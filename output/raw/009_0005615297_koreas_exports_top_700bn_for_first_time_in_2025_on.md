South Korean exports topped $700 billion for the first time in 2025, achieving an all-time record, despite the impact of U.S.-led tariffs.According to data released by the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy on Thursday, Korea’s outbound shipments soared 3.8 percent to $709.7 billion in 2025. It marks the first time in Korea’s history that exports have exceeded $700 billion, making Korea the sixth country in the world to do so.The trade balance also improved by $26.2 billion from the previous year, recording a trade surplus of $78 billion, the largest since 2017, when the surplus stood at $95.2 billion.Among the country’s 15 key export items, exports increased in six categories last year.In particular, semiconductors drove overall performance, with exports reaching a record high of $173.4 billion, up 22.2 percent from the previous year.Automobile exports also rose 1.7 percent on year to $72 billion, setting a new all-time high.Although exports to the United States declined due to tariff effects, strong demand for hybrid vehicles and used cars led to increased exports to the European Union and other markets.Export market diversification is seen as a key factor behind the record performance.While exports to China and the U.S. declined, shipments to ASEAN countries rose sharply.Exports to China fell 1.7 percent to $130.8 billion, while exports to the U.S. fell 3.8 percent to $122.9 billion. Outbound shipments to ASEAN increased 7.4 percent and exports to the EU jumped 3 percent.
