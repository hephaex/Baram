(LEAD) parliament-plenary (LEAD) Nat&#x27;l Assembly approves confirmation motion for state audit chief nominee (ATTN: UPDATES with confirmation motion approved; RECASTS headline, lead para)By Kim Seung-yeon SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- The National Assembly on Tuesday approved a confirmation motion for a nominee to head the state audit agency, making the appointment official. Parliament convened a plenary session and voted in favor of appointing Kim Ho-cheol, a human rights lawyer, as chair of the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI), a day after holding a confirmation hearing as required by law. Lawmakers voted 212 for and 34 against with five abstentions. Kim was nominated by President Lee Jae Myung for the BAI chair post earlier this month. His nomination was subject to parliamentary approval. A BAI chief serves a four-year term and may be reappointed for another single term. During the confirmation hearing Monday, Kim said he would consider revamping BAI&#x27;s internal oversight units to bolster the agency&#x27;s self-policing functions and restore public trust. The BAI has been at the center of a political controversy in recent years, with critics claiming the institution had been used for politically motivated audits under previous administrations. Kim vowed to fend off undue external interference and pressure to ensure the agency carries out its duties with independence and neutrality.
