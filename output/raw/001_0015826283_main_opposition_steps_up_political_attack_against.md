bribery allegations-politicsMain opposition steps up political attack against ruling party over bribery allegations surrounding lawmaker SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- The main opposition People Power Party (PPP) on Friday lashed out at the ruling Democratic Party (DP) over its response to bribery allegations involving a lawmaker expelled from the party, calling for a special counsel investigation. The DP has recently been rocked by allegations that an aide of Rep. Kang Sun-woo allegedly received 100 million won (US$69,250) from a Seoul city councilor in the lead-up to the 2022 local elections in exchange for a constituency nomination. The DP expelled Kang from the party Thursday, hours after she announced she would leave the party. &quot;The DP should not try to brush this over with a slap-on-the-wrist disciplinary show,&quot; PPP floor leader Rep. Song Eon-seog said. &quot;Special counsel investigations that the DP so cherishes and thinks of as a panacea are meant to be used in such situations.&quot;

The case has recently drawn public attention after a local media outlet released an audio recording of Kang discussing the episode with Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the same party, who at the time served as the secretary of the DP&#x27;s Seoul nomination committee. Kim, who also faces additional allegations of misconduct, resigned from the party&#x27;s floor leadership Tuesday. The DP has decided to take disciplinary measures against the lawmaker. &quot;The allegations of payments in exchange for nominations are a grave matter that could seriously damage trust in nomination and election procedures, which are central to democracy,&quot; Rep. Choi Eun-seok, the PPP&#x27;s senior floor spokesperson, said in a commentary.
