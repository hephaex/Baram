Mirae Asset Group is set to acquire Korbit Inc., South Korea’s fourth-largest digital asset exchange, in a deal that is expected to bring significant change to the domestic cryptocurrency market, which has long been dominated by Dunamu Inc.’s Upbit and Bithumb Co.According to industry sources on Sunday, Mirae Asset Group recently signed a memorandum of understanding to purchase most of the shares held by Korbit’s largest shareholder, NXC Corp., and second-largest shareholder, SK planet Co.Korbit is currently owned 60.5 percent by NXC, the holding company of Nexon Korea Corp., and 31.5 percent by SK planet Co.The transaction is expected to be valued at between 100 billion won ($69.3 million) and 140 billion won.The buyer is Mirae Asset Consulting Co., a non-financial affiliate of Mirae Asset Group, allowing the deal to bypass Korea’s separation between finance and virtual assets that has been in place since 2017.Global players like BlackRock Inc., Coinbase Inc., and Visa Inc. are increasingly linking traditional assets with digital assets, while expanding across borders.Mirae Asset Group is also expected to use the Korbit deal to advance its strategy of combining traditional finance with digital assets.The growing convergence between the two sectors is fueling expectations that Korea’s investment environment could improve.Funds flowing out of the country via blockchain to overseas exchanges totaled an estimated 124.3 trillion won during the first nine months of this year, according to simulated tracing conducted by Tiger Research and Kaiko at the request of Maeil Business.At the current pace, outflows could reach 160 trillion won in 2025 alone, roughly one-third of Korean investors’ total purchases of U.S. stocks this year.Korean investors are also estimated to have paid 2.73 trillion won in fees to Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, this year.That figure exceeds the projected operating profit of Korea Investment and Securities, which is expected to report the highest operating profit among domestic brokerages through the third quarter, at 1.89 trillion won.Some analysts say the large-scale outflow of crypto-related funds has contributed to the weakening of the Korean won. “Rigid domestic regulations are pushing capital overseas,” said an industry insider. “The outflow is likely to accelerate if current conditions persist.”
