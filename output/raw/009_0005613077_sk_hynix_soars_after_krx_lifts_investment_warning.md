SK hynix Inc. saw its shares soar nearly 6 percent on Monday morning, following the Korea Exchange’s announcement that the designation of the company as an investment caution stock has been lifted.Shares of SK hynix were trading at 633,000 won ($441) as of 9:03 a.m., up 5.68 percent from the previous session.The stock opened at 630,000 won, up 5.18 percent and at one point climbed as high as635,000 won.The Korea Exchange announced earlier that the designation of SK hynix as an investment caution stock would be lifted as of Monday.The exchange noted that the removal was due to market surveillance rules that took effect on Monday, which excludes the top 100 stocks by market cap from such warnings.The chipmaker had been flagged alongside other volatile stocks earlier this month, but benefited from the regulatory change.Separately, LG Energy Solution slid on Monday morning, following news of a termination of a large-scale battery contract.LG Energy Solution shares were trading at 376,500 won as of 9:12 a.m., down 1.83 percent from the previous session.Shortly after the market opened, the stock fell as much as 4.3 percent to 367,000 won.After the close on Friday, LG Energy Solution disclosed that it had mutually agreed to terminate an electric vehicle battery module supply contract signed in April last year, due to U.S. battery pack manufacturer Freudenberg Battery Power Systems exiting the battery business.The contract value amounts to 3.9 trillion won based on the exchange rate on the disclosure date.LG Energy Solution also disclosed earlier this month the termination of a 9.6 trillion won EV battery cell and module supply contract with U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co.
