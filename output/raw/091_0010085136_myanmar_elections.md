The State Administration Council (SAC), Myanmar&#x27;s military government, will hold its first national vote since the February 2021 coup in a multi-stage general election, with the first phase scheduled for 28 December 2025 and the second for 11 January 2026. Over 50 political parties have registered to participate in the election, according to the Union Election Commission (UEC).
