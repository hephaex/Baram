[LEAD]The special counsel probe into former First Lady Kim Keon-hee wrapped up without resolving several major allegations.A range of cases, from suspected bribery to controversies involving public projects and private events, were handed over to police.We have the details.[REPORT]The special counsel probe into former first lady Kim Keon-hee dealt with 16 allegations.The probe lasted for 180 days but many cases have been transferred to the police.Min Joong-ki / Special counsel (Dec. 29)Due to time constraints and limited capacity, unresolved cases will be transferred to the Nat&#x27;l Office of Investigation in accordance with law.These cases are largely of two types.First, there are cases where Kim&#x27;s involvement is suspected, such as the Yangpyeong Expressway route change, a private party held on a naval vessel, and a tea gathering at Jongmyo shrine.Favoritism allegations in the presidential residence construction and the cover-up of a bullying record involving a secretary&#x27;s child were also handed over to police.Cases of alleged preferential treatment for Jaseng Hospital of Korean Medicine, shady Covana Contents sponsorships, stock rigging by Sambu Construction, and election nomination interference involving lawmakers Yoon Sang-hyun and Lee Jun-seok were handed over to police after no link to Kim Keon-hee was confirmed.Kim Kyung-soo / Advisory lawyer for KBSReferring the cases to police is not ideal; the delay in resolving criminal allegations suggests limits in the special counsel’s investigative capacity.Following the suicide of a public official who was under probe in the Yangpyeong Expressway case, the team was accused of coercive investigation.Critics also accused investigators of bias after they failed to probe claims by former Unification Church executive Yoon Young-ho that money and valuables were given to ruling party politicians.This led to an unprecedented event in which special counsel Min Joong-ki was raided by the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials during the special probe period.Min also stirred controversy for directly meeting with a law enforcement officer-turned-lawyer for the Unification Church.He also received a complaint relating to past investments in unlisted shares.■ 제보하기▷ 전화 : 02-781-1234, 4444▷ 이메일 : kbs1234@kbs.co.kr▷ 카카오톡 : &#x27;KBS제보&#x27; 검색, 채널 추가▷ 네이버, 유튜브에서 KBS뉴스를 구독해주세요!
