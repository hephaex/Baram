The series has gained global recognition through exhibitions at the Sydney Biennale, Berlin’s Martin-Gropius-Bau and Manege Central Exhibition Hall in St. Petersburg.

&quot;Willing To Be Vulnerable-Transparent Balloon&quot; by Lee Bul (Courtesy of the artist and HO-AM Foundation)The 8.5-meter-tall floating balloon-like sculpture, created with translucent film, LED lighting, stainless steel and crystals, evokes contrasting ideas of futuristic optimism and the inherent vulnerability of modern ideals.Lee, who rose to prominence in the late 1980s has spent decades investigating utopian imagination and collective visions of the future. The artist&#x27; survey exhibition &quot;Lee Bul: From 1998 to Now&quot; is on view at the Leeum Museum of Art until Sunday.
