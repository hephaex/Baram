special counsel-CoupangSpecial prosecutors again raid Coupang over unpaid severance pay SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- A special counsel team again raided e-commerce giant Coupang Inc. on Monday as part of its compulsory investigation into allegations of unpaid severance pay for employees and senior prosecutors&#x27; intervention in favor of the management. Special counsel Ann Gweon-seob sent prosecutors and investigators to the company&#x27;s headquarters in the southern Seoul district of Songpa in the morning to secure data related to the payment of severance pay. The company is suspected of changing its employment rules in May 2023 to the disadvantage of its employees and failing to pay their severance pay. Last Tuesday and Wednesday, Ahn&#x27;s team searched Coupang&#x27;s head office and Coupang Fulfillment Services, a logistics subsidiary of Coupang, with the search and seizure warrant listing the companies as suspects violating the Act on the Guarantee of Employees&#x27; Retirement Benefits. The team suspects that Coupang failed to fulfill its obligation to pay severance pay worth 15.23 million won (US$10,620) to seven daily workers who had worked long hours at its logistics centers and were effectively considered &quot;full-time employees.&quot; Earlier in January, the Bucheon branch office of the labor ministry sent the case to the prosecution with a recommendation for indictment. But the Incheon District Prosecutors Office&#x27;s Bucheon branch decided not to indict Coupang in April.
