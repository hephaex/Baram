(LEAD) Hanwha Aerospace-Poland(LEAD) Hanwha Aerospace signs 5.6 tln-won Chunmoo rocket system export deal with Poland(ATTN: ADDS more details in last 5 paras, photo) SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- South Korean defense company Hanwha Aerospace Co. said Tuesday it has signed a 5.6 trillion-won (US$4 billion) contract with Poland&#x27;s arms procurement agency to supply Chunmoo multiple launch rocket systems. The Polish Armament Agency and a consortium comprising Hanwha Aerospace and Hanwha-WB Advanced System (HWB) signed the third-stage deal in Warsaw on Monday to provide the 80-kilometer-range guided missile known as the CGR-080, the company said in a press release.

Hanwha-WB is a joint venture between Hanwha Aerospace and WB Electronics, an affiliate of WB Group, Poland&#x27;s largest defense company. Under the contract, Chunmoo CGR-080 missiles will be manufactured at a dedicated plant in Poland operated by Hanwha-WB, with deliveries set to begin in 2030, the release said. The missiles will serve as the core ammunition for Poland&#x27;s Homar-K system, a Polish variant of the Chunmoo multiple launch rocket system, it said. &quot;The agreement fulfills our long-held ambition for production independence within the Homar-K program. By bringing together WB Electronics and Hanwha Aerospace, we are building a robust partnership with a trusted ally,&quot; Polish Deputy Prime Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz was quoted by Hanwha as saying. The deal involves technology transfer and aims to strengthen Poland&#x27;s defense capabilities by integrating local partners into the supply chain, the release said. Hanwha Aerospace President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Son Jae-il said the company will continue to cooperate with Poland&#x27;s defense industry to enhance the country&#x27;s security and deliver economic value. The latest contract builds on two previous agreements signed in 2022 and 2024. The first-stage deal in 2022 was valued at 5.03 trillion won, while the second-stage deal in 2024 totaled 2.2 trillion won.

With the latest deal, Poland has signed more than $10 billion worth of defense contracts with South Korea since President Lee Jae Myung took office in June, presidential chief of staff Kang Hoon-sik said. Kang, who attended the signing ceremony as Lee&#x27;s special envoy for strategic cooperation, said the government remains committed to its goal of turning South Korea into one of the world&#x27;s top four arms exporters. South Korea exported $15.2 billion worth of weapons in 2025 alone, with $14.2 billion of those contracts signed since June, according to him. &quot;The Polish government has publicly praised the capability and reliability of Korea&#x27;s defense industry, which has helped Korean weapons systems expand into Europe and Latin America,&quot; Kang told reporters upon his arrival at Incheon International Airport. Poland first signed major arms deals with South Korean companies in 2022 to purchase K2 tanks, K9 self-propelled howitzers and Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers, and clinched additional deals to bolster its military capabilities. kyongae.choi@yna.co.kr(END)
