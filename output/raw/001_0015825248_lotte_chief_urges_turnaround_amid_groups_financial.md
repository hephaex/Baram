Lotte Group-chairman message Lotte chief urges turnaround amid group&#x27;s financial challenges SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- Lotte Group Chairman Shin Dong-bin on Friday called for all-out efforts to achieve a turnaround this year, stressing the need for qualitative growth despite an unfavorable business environment. In his New Year&#x27;s message, Shin said the so-called three highs -- inflation, interest rates and exchange rates -- are expected to persist this year, while geopolitical risks will continue to weigh on consumer sentiment and drive up raw material prices. He added that the group&#x27;s core businesses require a fundamental overhaul amid structural changes in demographics. Lotte operates businesses spanning retail, petrochemicals, tourism and construction. In particular, Lotte&#x27;s petrochemical division has continued to post losses, weighing on the group&#x27;s overall performance amid a prolonged industry downturn. Lotte Chemical Corp. has sold stakes in overseas joint ventures and non-core assets since late 2024 as part of efforts to improve its financial structure. Under a government-led restructuring program, Lotte Chemical said in November it would spin off its naphtha cracking center (NCC) operations at the Daesan petrochemical complex in Seosan, about 100 kilometers south of Seoul, to form a new entity with HD Hyundai Chemical. The move aims to proactively adjust inventories and better respond to market demand. Shin called on employees to generate &quot;differentiated results based on autonomy,&quot; urging them to independently identify challenges and devote themselves to solving them to create distinctive outcomes.
