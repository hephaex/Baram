Korean Air-data leak Korean Air employees&#x27; personal info leaked after supplier hit by hacking attack SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- Personal information of employees at Korean Air Co., South Korea&#x27;s largest flag carrier, has been leaked after a partner firm supplying in-flight meals and onboard sales services was hit by a cyberattack, according to industry sources Monday. According to the sources, Korean Air issued an internal notice earlier in the day informing employees that KC&amp;D, the airline&#x27;s catering and onboard sales supplier, had recently suffered a cyberattack by a hacker group. It marked the latest in a series of recent data breach cases among major businesses in various sectors, including Coupang Inc., KT Corp. and Shinhan Card Co. According to the airline, the breach led to the exposure of personal data of Korean Air employees stored on KC&amp;D&#x27;s servers, including names and phone numbers. Korean Air said it became aware of the incident after being notified by KC&amp;D and added it has taken immediate emergency security measures and reported the case to relevant authorities. It also urged employees to remain vigilant against potential secondary damage, warning them to remain cautious of suspicious text messages or emails.
