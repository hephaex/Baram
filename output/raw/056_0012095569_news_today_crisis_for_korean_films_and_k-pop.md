[LEAD]K-content continues to draw global attention, from films to K-pop.But a major foreign media outlet is now warning that behind the popularity, Korea&#x27;s cultural industries may be facing a structural crisis.[REPORT]On Sunday, local time, the Guardian published an article titled &quot;Almost collapsed: behind the Korean film crisis and why K-pop isn&#x27;t immune.&quot;It reported that Korea&#x27;s film industry is on the verge of collapse, which is not a temporary phenomenon but a structural decline.The British news outlet analyzed that it is the result of a vicious cycle in which creators have moved to streaming platforms like Netflix from movie theaters and the film industry cannot afford rising production costs.It also paid attention to last year&#x27;s decline in K-pop&#x27;s physical album sales, which was the first major drop in a decade.Adding that it is uncertain whether the K-pop industry will continue to produce global groups like BTS and Blackpink.The Guardian stressed the need for the K-pop industry to break away from its excessive dependence on the core fandom and to focus on consolidating its sustainability.■ 제보하기▷ 전화 : 02-781-1234, 4444▷ 이메일 : kbs1234@kbs.co.kr▷ 카카오톡 : &#x27;KBS제보&#x27; 검색, 채널 추가▷ 네이버, 유튜브에서 KBS뉴스를 구독해주세요!
