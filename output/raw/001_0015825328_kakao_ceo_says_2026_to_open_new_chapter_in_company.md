Kakao-CEO messageKakao CEO says 2026 to open new chapter in company&#x27;s AI, fandom platform biz SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- The chief of Kakao Corp. said Friday that 2026 will mark the beginning of a new chapter for the company&#x27;s artificial intelligence (AI) and global fandom-based platform business. &quot;Last year marked a period of consolidation, where we strengthened our foundation, refined our systems and focused the group&#x27;s capabilities on our core competencies,&quot; Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Chung Shin-a said in a New Year&#x27;s message. &quot;Now is the time to shift gears toward growth, building upon this concentrated energy,&quot; she added. Chung said human-centric AI and Kakao&#x27;s &quot;global fandom operating system&quot; will serve as the two pillars of the tech giant&#x27;s growth in 2026. The company&#x27;s AI strategy aims to evolve generative AI tools into agentic AI that can operate autonomously and support decision-making while pursuing external partnerships for infrastructure investments, she said. She added that Kakao will build a global ecosystem enabling fans of its intellectual properties and platforms, including webtoons, TV shows and video games, to communicate and create value. &quot;The year 2026 will be the start of Kakao&#x27;s new 15 years,&quot; Chung said. &quot;We will not be complacent with past success but will continue to take on audacious challenges by using AI to amplify our capabilities and ideas.&quot;
