state audit chief nominee-hearingState audit chief nominee to consider revamp of internal oversight units SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- The nominee for South Korea&#x27;s top audit post said Monday that he would consider revamping units responsible for investigating misconduct or corruption by agency officials in a bid to restore public trust. Kim Ho-cheol, nominee for chair of the Board of Audit and Inspection (BAI), made the remark during a parliamentary hearing on his nomination, pledging to bolster the agency&#x27;s self-policing functions amid criticism over weak internal oversight. &quot;I humbly accept criticism that the oversight of misconduct by BAI officials has been insufficient,&quot; Kim said during the hearing at the National Assembly. &quot;I will work to strengthen the agency&#x27;s self-policing functions.&quot; Kim, a human rights lawyer, was nominated by President Lee Jae Myung for the BAI chair post earlier this month. His nomination is subject to parliamentary approval.

The BAI has been at the center of political controversy in recent years, with critics claiming the institution had been used for politically motivated audits under previous administrations. Kim pointed out that the BAI has lost public trust as the state audit agency as it has failed to uphold the principles of independence and neutrality. He also said that the agency&#x27;s &quot;excessive policy audits and coercive inspections&quot; of public officials have stifled the civil service. &quot;I intend to lead by example in fending off undue external interference and pressure and overhauling the system to ensure that the Council of Commissioners -- BAI&#x27;s top decision-making body -- can operate in line with law and principles, and that the staff can work without being swayed by outside influence,&quot; he said. Kim vowed to enhance the procedural legitimacy of audits to ensure that the rights of those under investigation are fully protected and that the audits are conducted in a way that would be respectful of human rights. elly@yna.co.kr(END)
