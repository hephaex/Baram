science minister-Coupang Science minister reaffirms Coupang data leak affected 33 mln customers SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- Science Minister Bae Kyung-hoon on Tuesday reaffirmed that a recent data leak at Coupang Inc. affected 33 million customers in South Korea, voicing concerns over an assessment report released separately by the U.S.-listed e-commerce giant last week. &quot;The joint government–private sector investigation, including the Personal Information Protection Commission and the police, revealed that the names and email addresses of more than 33 million users were leaked,&quot; Bae said during a parliamentary session. The remarks came after Coupang claimed last week that data from only about 3,000 accounts had actually been downloaded and later deleted by the suspect. &quot;We cannot agree with that claim,&quot; Bae said. The minister said details such as users&#x27; addresses and order information were also believed to have been leaked. &quot;We express grave concern toward Coupang, which issued an announcement that had not been coordinated with the government,&quot; he said.
