(2nd LD) Lee-Cheong Wa Dae (2nd LD) Lee begins work at Cheong Wa Dae after presidential office relocation(ATTN: ADDS details in paras 3-9)By Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- President Lee Jae Myung made his first commute to work at Cheong Wa Dae on Monday, following the formal relocation of the presidential office to the historic compound about seven months after he took office. A motorcade escorting Lee&#x27;s vehicle passed through the front gate of the main building at around 9:10 a.m. as dozens of his supporters waved the national flag and shouted his name near the entrance to the compound.

At the main building, Lee held a tea meeting with senior aides to receive briefings on key pending issues and upcoming work plans, including those related to the economy and social affairs, presidential spokesperson Kang Yu-jung told reporters. He then visited the National Crisis Management Center inside the complex, known as Cheong Wa Dae&#x27;s underground bunker, to check systems related to security and disaster response. The center was first established in 1976 and was equipped with chemical, biological and radiological protection capabilities in 2003. Its facilities have since been refurbished as part of preparations for the return to Cheong Wa Dae, Kang said. After the tour, Lee moved to the Yeomin Building complex, where he granted diplomatic consent, known as agrement, to the incoming ambassador from the Republic of Benin. Lee&#x27;s main office is located in the Yeomin building, about 500 meters from the main building that houses senior aides and staff, which is expected to help promote closer communication with officials. The iconic main building with its blue roof will mainly be used for formal events, such as summits and credential ceremonies. Lee&#x27;s choice of the Yeomin Building, which means &quot;with the people&quot; in Korean, as his work space reflects the administration&#x27;s commitment to running a transparent and pragmatic government that communicates closely with the public, according to Kang.

At midnight, a presidential flag bearing two phoenixes was raised, formally restoring the name Cheong Wa Dae. With the official residence still undergoing renovation to fix damage from when the complex was opened to the public under the previous administration, Lee will continue commuting from his current residence in Hannam-dong for the time being, according to his office. Lee&#x27;s predecessor, former ousted President Yoon Suk Yeol, had moved the office to the defense ministry compound in Seoul&#x27;s Yongsan district when he took office in 2022.

On Sunday, the Presidential Security Service said it had completed joint security inspections with 14 agencies, including the National Intelligence Service, the police and the military. The checks covered key facilities at Cheong Wa Dae and nearby mountains, focusing on wiretapping risks and information and communications systems.
