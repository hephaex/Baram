BOK-inflation BOK to step up monitoring of prices amid high living costs SEOUL, Dec. 31 (Yonhap) -- The central bank said Wednesday it will closely monitor consumer inflation given high living costs, though it projects inflation to gradually trend down near 2 percent. Bank of Korea (BOK) Deputy Gov. Kim Woong made the remarks during a meeting to review inflation trends after government data showed consumer prices rose 2.3 percent on-year in December, remaining above the bank&#x27;s 2 percent target for the fourth consecutive month. &quot;Consumer prices in December rose at a slower pace than the previous month&#x27;s 2.4 percent, as gains in agricultural, livestock and fisheries prices eased despite continued increases in oil prices driven by the weak won,&quot; Kim said. &quot;But everyday living costs remain elevated in the upper 2 percent range, and so we will continue to closely monitor prices, paying attention to the impact of the won-dollar exchange rate and seasonal factors,&quot; he added. The BOK expected consumer inflation to gradually ease toward around 2 percent as core inflation remains stable at about 2 percent and falling global oil prices help curb inflationary pressures. For the whole of 2025, the government data showed the country&#x27;s consumer prices gained 2.1 percent from a year earlier, the slowest on-year increase since 2020.
