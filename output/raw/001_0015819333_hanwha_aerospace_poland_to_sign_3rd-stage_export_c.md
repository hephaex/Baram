The deal, reportedly valued at over 5 trillion won (US$3.48 billion), will be signed between Hanwha Aerospace, the Polish government and the country&#x27;s largest private defense firm, WB Electronics, following two previous deals in 2022 and 2024, according to the sources. The first-stage deal in 2022 was valued at 5.035 trillion won, while the second-stage deal in 2024 was valued at 2.2 trillion won. President Lee Jae Myung&#x27;s chief of staff, Kang Hoon-sik, is reportedly set to attend the signing ceremony. Lee&#x27;s office said earlier that Kang had left the country Sunday as a presidential envoy, but did not disclose his destination.
