(News Focus) NK leader-daughter(News Focus) Tribute by daughter of N.K. leader seen as reinforcing image of potential successorBy Kim Soo-yeon SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un&#x27;s teenage daughter, Ju-ae, has paid tribute at the family mausoleum for the first time, reinforcing her image as North Korea&#x27;s potential successor of the ruling family&#x27;s &quot;Paektu bloodline,&quot; experts said. But some observers said her presence at the mausoleum, along with her appearances at major inspection sites, is part of moves to build a narrative as a possible successor, not a sign that North Korea &quot;formalizes&quot; her status as Kim&#x27;s successor. Kim Ju-ae, believed to be born in 2013, was seen paying tribute at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the incumbent leader&#x27;s late grandfather and father lie in state, together with her father and mother on New Year&#x27;s Day, according to photos published by the North&#x27;s state media. It marked her first known visit to the family mausoleum since she appeared in North Korean state media for the first time in November 2022, when she visited the launch site of a Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile. The Kumsusan Palace of the Sun symbolizes the legacy of the power succession of the ruling Kim&#x27;s family.

Experts said Ju-ae&#x27;s presence at the mausoleum and taking the central position at the front row may be intended to highlight her status as a potential successor of the Paektu bloodline. Lim Eul-chul, a professor at Kyungnam University&#x27;s Institute for Far Eastern Studies, said the move indicates North Korea reaffirmed Ju-ae as a &quot;successor of revolution&quot; inheriting the legacy of the late former leaders. &quot;Her tribute signals that she could play a political role starting in 2026,&quot; Lim said, noting that the upcoming key party congress set for early this year could become a watershed in clarifying her status. In January 2024, South Korea&#x27;s spy agency assessed Ju-ae as the North&#x27;s &quot;most likely successor,&quot; in its first evaluation of her possible succession in the reclusive regime. Since the first public appearance in 2022, Ju-ae has accompanied her father on his inspections into key military and economic sites. Late last year, she appeared more frequently on Kim Jong-un&#x27;s inspections, including the site of building a nuclear-powered submarine and opening ceremonies for regional factories. Still, some experts said Ju-ae&#x27;s tribute at the mausoleum is designed to highlight the image of a &quot;loving family&quot; or the symbol of the future generation. &quot;If only Ju-ae accompanied her father, it could be viewed from a different perspective. But given Kim Jong-un&#x27;s wife, Ri Sol-ju, also appeared at the location, it strongly points to a family image,&quot; Hong Min, a senior researcher at the Korea Institute for National Unification, said. North Korea&#x27;s state media released photos of Ju-ae paying tribute to the late former leaders but did not carry any report on her presence.

In September 2010, Kim Jong-un was officially anointed as Kim Jong-il&#x27;s successor after being granted the title of the general of the Korean People&#x27;s Army and appointed as the vice chairman of the ruling party&#x27;s central military commission at a key party meeting. He paid tribute at the family mausoleum together with his father in October that year. Some experts said attention is now being paid to whether Ju-ae&#x27;s status would be officially clarified following the upcoming ninth party congress. Professor Lim forecast Ju-ae may appear on the main podium at the party congress&#x27; venue or she could be called &quot;comrade&quot; at the party event. North Korea&#x27;s state media has begun calling Ju-ae Kim&#x27;s &quot;respected&quot; daughter, changing its previous manner of naming her as his beloved or the most beloved daughter, fueling speculation she may be groomed as Kim&#x27;s successor. sooyeon@yna.co.kr(END)
