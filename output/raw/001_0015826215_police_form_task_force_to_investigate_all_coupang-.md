Coupang-policePolice form task force to investigate all Coupang-related suspicions SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- Police have formed a task force to comprehensively investigate suspicions related to e-commerce giant Coupang Inc., police officials said Friday. The task force (TF) headed by an inspector general-level officer was launched at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency on Thursday to intensively investigate Coupang-related allegations, they said. The team consists of 86 members, including the agency&#x27;s cyber investigation division, which was investigating the company&#x27;s massive data leak, and those from its financial and public crimes divisions, they added. It is expected to simultaneously investigate all allegations regarding Coupang as lawsuits and accusations against the company continue to pour in, including an alleged cover-up of an industrial disaster. The TF will also handle the case of former Coupang CEO Park Dae-jun, who is accused of having an expensive meal with Rep. Kim Byung-kee of the ruling Democratic Party. In addition, the team is expected to handle complaints against Coupang founder Kim Bom-suk and Harold Rogers, interim CEO of Coupang, who are accused of violating the law on testimony and appraisal at the National Assembly.
