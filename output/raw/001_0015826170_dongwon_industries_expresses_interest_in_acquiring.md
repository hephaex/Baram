Dongwon Industries-HMM Dongwon Industries expresses &#x27;interest&#x27; in acquiring shipper HMMBy Choi Kyong-ae SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- Dongwon Industries Co., the holding company of tuna-to-logistics conglomerate Dongwon Group, on Friday expressed its interest in acquiring HMM Co., the country&#x27;s leading shipping company. &quot;We have an interest in taking over HMM, but no specific decision has been made yet,&quot; Dongwon Industries said in a regulatory filing in response to media reports on Dongwon&#x27;s possible move to take over HMM. Dongwon Industries is one of two major potential bidders seeking to acquire HMM for business synergies, along with steelmaker POSCO Group. In a separate filing on Wednesday, POSCO Holdings said it is reviewing whether a possible acquisition of HMM could generate strategic synergies with its core steel business. &quot;No decision has been made yet on whether to participate in a future auction,&quot; POSCO said. Industry officials said an auction could take place after HMM completes its planned relocation from Seoul to Busan, about 400 kilometers south of the capital, in line with pledges made by President Lee Jae Myung during his presidential campaign. The Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries relocated to the port city last month as part of the Lee administration&#x27;s initiative to promote balanced regional development. Two state-run entities -- the Korea Development Bank (KDB) and the Korea Ocean Business Corp. (KOBC) -— currently hold 35.42 percent and 35.08 percent stakes in the nation&#x27;s top container shipper, respectively. In late 2023, the two institutions selected a consortium led by poultry processor Harim Corp. as the preferred bidder for HMM, but talks collapsed in February the following year after the sides failed to bridge differences. Dongwon Group is the parent company of U.S.-based canned tuna maker StarKist Co.
