# HD Construction Equipment launches with global No.1 ambition

HD Construction Equipment, formed through the merger of HD Hyundai Construction Equipment and HD Hyundai Infracore, has officially launched as South Korea’s largest construction machinery company, with a strategic focus on strengthening sales capabilities to drive revenue growth.The company held a launch ceremony for the integrated entity on Thursday at its Ulsan campus. With the merger of the nation’s No.1 and No.2 construction equipment makers, HD Construction Equipment now operates domestic production facilities in Ulsan, Incheon and Gunsan, as well as overseas manufacturing bases in India, China, Brazil and Norway. The combined entity generates annual sales of about 8 trillion won ($5.59 billion).Industry watchers expect expanded synergies in sales operations following the integration. Since HD Hyundai acquired Doosan Infracore in August 2021, the two companies had been managed independently while gradually building synergies in technology, quality and procurement. The latest merger is widely seen as the next phase, bringing sales operations together on top of that foundation.

Chung Ki-sun, chairman of HD Hyundai, has consistently emphasized strengthening sales competitiveness in the construction equipment segment since taking office. The company’s first chief executive is Moon Jae-young, a former chief sales officer at both firms who played a key role in establishing and expanding the Indian subsidiary.Going forward, HD Construction Equipment plans to refine market strategies by region. Financing will also serve as a key pillar of its sales strategy, with the company seeking partnerships with local financial institutions to offer competitive financing products that combine equipment supply with financial infrastructure.The company has set a target of achieving 14.8 trillion won in annual revenue by 2030. Its growth strategy spans core construction equipment, engine operations and after-market services, with the aim of enhancing both product competitiveness and service offerings to upgrade its profit structure.Chung said he hopes the passion of HD Construction Equipment will be carried forward into next-generation models, adding that a full-scale overhaul across production, quality and sales will position the company as another “global No.1,” following shipbuilding, within the HD Hyundai group.
