(Yonhap)An analysis showed Sunday that South Korea&#x27;s sea surface levels rose by 11.5 centimeters from 1989 to 2024, possibly affected by global warming.Twenty-one observation points across the nations coastal lines showed that sea levels rose by an average of 3.2 millimeters per year, according to the report by the state-run Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency. The annual rises in the East Sea and the West Sea were more profound, at between 3 and 3.6 millimeters, while seas rose relatively slowly on the south coast, at between 2.6 and 3.4 millimeters.The data indicated a particularly steep rise in sea levels in all coastal areas from 1995-2004 (5-8 millimeters per year), continuing at a similar rate on the eastern coast from 2005-2014, with western shores and Jeju Island resuming that pace from 2015-2024.&quot;We&#x27;ve confirmed that the rise in sea level is a phenomenon that occurs differently depending on the region. ... These distinct characteristics must be factored in when making policies on management of the coastal areas and climate change,&quot; officials at the agency was quoted as saying.Global factors such as the shift in temperature and salinity of the ocean water — effects of global warming and the melting of glaciers — are thought to have contributed to the change in sea levels. Other factors such as the shifts in atmospheric and ocean circulation are also believed to have played a part.The latest findings will be used by the government in assessing the flooding risks of each area, as well as designing and maintaining of facilities in the coastal regions.
