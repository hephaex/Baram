[LEAD]Illegal fishing by Chinese vessels in Korean waters is again on the rise, prompting tougher action from authorities.Following President Lee Jae Myung&#x27;s call for a strong response, the Coast Guard is moving to sharply increase penalties and bolster enforcement.[REPORT]This Chinese fishing boat was seized in waters off Jeju in January.When the wooden cover was lifted, Korean coast guards found fish and sea products illegally caught in Korean waters.The fish were kept in what they call a &quot;secret fish hold.&quot;Secret fish hold found just now!This fishing boat is armed with steel hooks and barbed wires to keep Korean coast guards from climbing aboard.Chinese fishing boats often ignore the Korea Coast Guard&#x27;s orders to stop and then flee.Despite repeated orders to stop, a Chinese vessel is fleeing while zigzagging.Illegal fishing by Chinese vessels, which briefly slowed after the COVID-19 pandemic, is once again on the rise.Forty-six vessels were seized last year.This year, another 10 have already been captured by the middle of this month.As the situation worsened, even the president asked for tougher responses.Lee Jae Myung / PresidentThat&#x27;s so bad. They break the law and try to flee.Fines should be so high that even 10 vessels pooling money find it hard to pay.The Coast Guard decided to raise the security deposit imposed on Chinese fishing vessels from up to 300 million won to 1 billion won, or some 700,000 U.S. dollars.From 2028, it will also begin the phased introduction of 500-ton patrol vessels dedicated to cracking down on illegal fishing.■ 제보하기▷ 전화 : 02-781-1234, 4444▷ 이메일 : kbs1234@kbs.co.kr▷ 카카오톡 : &#x27;KBS제보&#x27; 검색, 채널 추가▷ 네이버, 유튜브에서 KBS뉴스를 구독해주세요!
