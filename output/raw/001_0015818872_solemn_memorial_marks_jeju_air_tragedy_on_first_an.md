Jeju Air crash-memorial Solemn memorial marks Jeju Air tragedy on first anniversary By Kim Seung-yeon SEOUL/MUAN, South Korea, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- Bereaved family members and government officials gathered Monday for a solemn memorial ceremony marking the first anniversary of the deadly plane crash in the country&#x27;s southwest that claimed 179 lives, with many still seeking closure that remains elusive. More than 1,200 people, including grieving families, government officials and lawmakers, attended the memorial to pay tribute to the victims of the Jeju Air plane crash at Muan International Airport on Dec. 29 last year. The passenger plane from Bangkok attempted a belly landing without its landing gear after a bird strike, overshot the runway and slammed into a concrete embankment at the airport. The crash sparked an immediate explosion, killing all but two crew members. The accident, one of the deadliest aviation disasters in the country&#x27;s history, prompted a full-scale investigation into the cause of the crash, but the victims&#x27; families have voiced dissatisfaction with the government-led probe, arguing that it seeks to pin the blame solely on the deceased pilot.

Before the ceremony began, sirens sounded for one minute starting at 9:03 a.m., the exact time the accident occurred. The memorial opened with a classical music performance, followed by a moment of silence and the laying of flowers. Bereaved families and other attendees took turns placing white chrysanthemums at the altar to honor the souls of the 179 victims, whose names were read out one by one. The passenger terminal where the memorial was held filled with sobs and anguished cries each time a victim&#x27;s name was called out. Families mourned as they leaned against relatives in tears, some clutching their chests in anguish. Kim Yoo-jin, head of the group representing the victims&#x27; families, recalled how her life &quot;collapsed completely&quot; beneath the words &quot;all aboard killed,&quot; as she watched ambulances leave with their sirens turned off. &quot;The tragedy will never truly end unless responsibility for the disaster is fully addressed,&quot; she said in her remarks at the ceremony.

After the ceremony, the families visited the site of the concrete structure as a gesture of remembrance and to bid farewell to their loved ones. In a video message, President Lee Jae Myung offered apologies to the victims and their grieving families, pledging a credible probe into the crash and full support for the families. &quot;I know no words can fully offer comfort,&quot; Lee said in the message. &quot;As the president entrusted with protecting the lives and safety of the people, I offer my deepest apology.&quot; The ruling and opposition parties offered condolences to the victims and pledged to make every effort to reaffirm their commitment to get to the bottom of the tragedy. Civic groups also issued statements urging the government to thoroughly uncover the truth behind the fatal crash.
