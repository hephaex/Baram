# AI takes center stage in New Year messages from Korea’s top conglomerates

Artificial intelligence emerged as the defining theme of 2026 for South Korea’s corporate leaders, with major business groups such as SK Group and Doosan Group pledging a sweeping transformation into AI-driven enterprises.In New Year’s addresses released on Thursday, Chey Tae-won, chairman of SK Group, and Park Jeong-won, chairman of Doosan Group, both stressed that their groups aim to move beyond simply adopting AI technologies to fundamentally reshaping their business models as AI solution providers.

Chey reflected that decades of steady progress had ultimately prepared SK for the AI era, presenting “Seungpungparang” — a phrase meaning “riding the wind and breaking the waves” — as the group’s theme for the year. The expression underscores SK’s ambition to harness the powerful momentum of AI to navigate intense global competition.“The AI era has only just begun, and opportunities are limitless,” Chey said, defining SK as an “AI business operator.” He emphasized the need to build integrated AI solutions by bringing together the capabilities of SK affiliates across semiconductors, energy, telecommunications, construction and biotechnology.The strategy calls for strengthening core businesses while layering AI innovation on top to create new business models. Industry observers see this as an effort to expand the global trust SK has built through AI semiconductors such as high-bandwidth memory (HBM) into a broader group-wide AI ecosystem.

Park of Doosan also highlighted “accelerating AI transformation (AX)” as the group’s top priority, saying Doosan possesses the manufacturing capabilities and data needed to lead the era of physical AI. “Companies that fail to secure AI-based competitiveness will inevitably fall behind,” he warned.Park pointed to the vast hardware data accumulated in power generation equipment, construction machinery and robotics, calling it Doosan’s unique strength in spearheading the physical AI era.Meanwhile, Chung Ji-sun, chairman of Hyundai Department Store Group, urged preemptive investment and innovation in work practices. He stressed the importance of strengthening AX infrastructure to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency, noting that greater uncertainty requires an agile execution system that enables rapid experimentation and swift adjustments.
