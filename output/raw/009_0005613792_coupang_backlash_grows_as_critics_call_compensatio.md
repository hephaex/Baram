# Coupang backlash grows as critics call compensation plan promotional

Public anger toward Coupang continues to mount despite the South Korean e-commerce giant unveiling a customer compensation package worth more than 1 trillion won ($700 million) in total, following a personal data breach and ahead of a National Assembly hearing.On Monday, interim Chief Executive Harold Rogers announced a customer compensation plan totaling 1.68 trillion won, pledging that Coupang would use the incident as an opportunity to recommit to customer-centric values and restore trust.The announcement followed an apology issued a day earlier by Coupang Inc. Chairman and Coupang founder Bom Kim, who acknowledged shortcomings in the company’s initial response and communication after the incident.Public reaction, however, has been largely negative. Online communities criticized the compensation plan as superficial, with some users mocking the vouchers as “nominal 50,000-won coupons” and accusing Coupang of using the scheme to promote lesser-known services.Criticism has focused on restrictions on where the vouchers can be used. While Coupang provided 5,000-won vouchers for its core shopping platform and Coupang Eats, it allocated 20,000 won vouchers each to Coupang Travel and luxury beauty and fashion platform R.Lux, both of which have relatively low brand recognition.Data from Wiseapp Retail show Coupang’s monthly active users totaled 34,398,407 last month, while Coupang Eats recorded 12,050,742 users. Usage data for Coupang Travel and R.Lux are not separately disclosed.Critics also argue the plan could drive additional sales rather than provide meaningful compensation, as relatively few products on Coupang Travel and R.Lux are priced below 20,000 won, effectively requiring users to spend more to redeem the vouchers.Professor Choi Chul of Sookmyung Women’s University said consumers largely view Coupang’s response as passive given its dominant market position, questioning whether the delayed compensation demonstrates genuine accountability.Coupang has stressed that the scale of the compensation package was an extraordinary decision when viewed against its profit margins. The company said its net profit stood at approximately 94 billion won last year, while net profit from the first through third quarters of this year totaled just 380 billion won, meaning the compensation plan far exceeds recent earnings levels.An industry source said the package amounts to roughly 30 percent of the total investment Coupang has made to build its so-called “rocket delivery zones,” adding that even when all of the company’s operating profits to date are combined, it has never generated enough earnings to comfortably absorb a payout of this magnitude. “If compensation were set at 200,000 to 300,000 won per person, as some politicians are demanding, the total cost would exceed 10 trillion won,” the source said. “That would put the company at risk of a survival crisis.”Lee Eun-hee, a professor of consumer studies at Inha University, noted that court rulings in past personal data breach cases have typically awarded around 100,000 won per person, saying the level itself is not entirely unreasonable when legal costs are taken into account. “That said, while it is true that retailers operate on thin margins, the bigger issue is that this compensation plan does not convey a sense that customers are being genuinely respected,” she said.Political backlash has intensified as Kim declined to attend the parliamentary hearing scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, prompting accusations of misleading the public. Lawmakers have warned of a potential state audit, while police are accelerating analysis of evidence seized during a week-long search of Coupang offices.Authorities are also conducting forensic analysis on devices voluntarily submitted by Coupang, amid concerns over possible evidence contamination after the company acknowledged conducting its own internal forensic review prior to submission.
