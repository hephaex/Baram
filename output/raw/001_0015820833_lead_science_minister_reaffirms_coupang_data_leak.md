(LEAD) science minister-Coupang(LEAD) Science minister reaffirms Coupang data leak affected 33 mln customers(ATTN: RECASTS lead; ADDS details throughout) SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- Science Minister Bae Kyung-hoon on Tuesday reaffirmed that a recent data leak at Coupang Inc. affected 33 million customers in South Korea, noting the U.S. commerce giant had &quot;malicious intent&quot; in its unilateral release of its own assessment report that claimed significantly less damage last week. &quot;The joint government–private sector investigation, including the Personal Information Protection Commission and the police, revealed that the names and email addresses of more than 33 million users were leaked,&quot; Bae said during a parliamentary session. The remarks came after Coupang claimed last week that data from only about 3,000 accounts had actually been downloaded and later deleted by the suspect. &quot;We cannot agree with that claim,&quot; Bae said. The minister said details such as users&#x27; addresses and order information were also believed to have been leaked. &quot;We express grave concern toward Coupang, which issued an announcement that had not been coordinated with the government,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe Coupang had an extremely malicious intent.&quot; Bae pointed out that the suspect accessed Coupang&#x27;s servers and freely viewed and downloaded users&#x27; information. The minister added the laptop submitted by Coupang, owned by a former employee suspected to be behind the leak, does not prove that only 3,000 accounts were compromised. &quot;The suspect could have uploaded the information to a cloud server rather than saving it on a laptop or desktop computer, and we need to conduct such analysis,&quot; he said.
