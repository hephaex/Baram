cybersecurity-corporate investments S. Korean firms&#x27; investment in cybersecurity up 14 pct in 2025By Kang Yoon-seung SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- South Korean businesses&#x27; expenditure on data protection rose 14.3 percent from a year earlier in 2025, data showed Tuesday, amid companies having faced increased threats involving customer information theft this year. Local companies spent 2.4 trillion won (US$1.67 billion) in related areas this year, compared with 2.1 trillion won posted in 2024, according to the Ministry of Science and ICT. The findings were based on analysis of regulatory filings submitted by 773 companies. According to the ministry, the number of employees dedicated to data protection came to 8,506 this year, up 10.7 percent from 7,681 in 2024. &quot;The increase in both data protection-related expenditures and the number of relevant employees simultaneously indicates businesses&#x27; growing interest in the area,&quot; the ministry said in a release. By industry, financial and insurance companies spent an average of 8.5 billion won, followed by information and telecommunications firms with 6.2 billion won. &quot;The policy requiring companies to disclose their data protection activities will encourage firms to voluntarily engage in cybersecurity efforts, producing positive outcomes such as increased investment and employment,&quot; Choi Woo-hyuk, director general at the ministry&#x27;s network policy division, said in the release. Choi added that the government will work to establish a safe and reliable digital environment by expanding the scope of companies subject to the filings. Currently, internet service providers and data center operators, along with companies in other designated sectors with annual sales of at least 300 billion won and 1 million daily users, are required to disclose such information, although some companies file voluntarily.
