South Korean banks have resumed normal household lending operations at the start of the new year, raising expectations of easing credit conditions as lending caps that were exhausted at the end of last year have been reset.According to sources on Thursday, banks are reopening applications for mortgage loans that use Mortgage Credit Insurance (MCI) and Mortgage Credit Guarantee (MCG), as well as non-face-to-face mortgage lending, which had previously been suspended. Some banks are also normalizing the acceptance of unsecured personal loans that had been partially halted.KB Kookmin Bank will resume new mortgage loans using MCI on Friday after suspending such products through the end of last year. Woori Bank has lifted the sales cap on real estate-backed loan products that had been imposed on individual branches, which had been set at 1 billion won ($700,000) per month. Hana Bank has also restarted the acceptance of mortgage loan applications scheduled for execution this year.
