KRX-chairman message KRX chief vows to extend stock trading hours, boost local capital market SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- The head of South Korea&#x27;s main bourse operator vowed Friday efforts to upgrade the country&#x27;s capital market by extending trading hours and strengthening crackdowns on unfair trading practices. Jeong Eun-bo, the chairman of the Korea Exchange (KRX), made the remarks at an event celebrating the first trading day of the new year, held at the KRX&#x27;s office in Seoul. &quot;Our capital market is on pace for normalization, with the benchmark KOSPI breaking the 4,000-mark point and other market indexes, such as PER (price-to-earnings ratio), showing signs of improvement,&quot; Jeong said. &quot;The local capital market should overcome the &#x27;Korea Discount&#x27; and advance into the premium market,&quot; he added. To that end, the KRX will introduce an artificial intelligence (AI)-based monitoring system, Jeong said. It will also strengthen a crackdown on unfair trading through the joint response team launched last year to root out stock price manipulation. Jeong also said pledged to extend trading hours, gradually introduce a 24-hour trading system and launch new investment products, including exchange-traded funds and derivatives holding virtual assets.
