PM-new year PM says gov&#x27;t focus in 2026 on strategic industry growth, Korean Peninsula peaceBy Lee Haye-ah SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- Prime Minister Kim Min-seok said Friday the government&#x27;s focus in the new year will be on fostering strategic industries, protecting people&#x27;s lives from disasters and promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula. Kim outlined the priorities during a ceremony marking the year&#x27;s first day of work at the government complex in the central city of Sejong, saying they will be pursued under the three key goals of creating an open government, a government that listens to the voices in the field and a nation confident on the international stage. &quot;First of all, we will put our utmost efforts into fostering future strategic industries,&quot; he said, listing artificial intelligence, bio, contents and culture, defense and energy as examples abbreviated as &quot;ABCDE.&quot; &quot;Second of all, we will place the value of respect for life at the center of state affairs,&quot; he said, citing plans to strengthen the government&#x27;s responsibility to protect lives from industrial disasters, suicides, wildfires and other preventable deaths. As the third priority, the prime minister said the government will not stop its efforts for peace. &quot;Since immediately after its launch, the Lee Jae Myung government has taken preemptive measures to reduce consuming conflicts, such as those involving trash balloons and loudspeakers,&quot; he said, referring to North Korea&#x27;s 2024 sending of trash-carrying balloons into South Korea and the two sides&#x27; blaring of loudspeaker propaganda messages across the border. &quot;Our government will continue to leave open the possibility of dialogue and build a Korean Peninsula of peaceful coexistence and prosperity,&quot; he said.
