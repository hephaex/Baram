household loans-declineMajor banks&#x27; household loans fall in Dec. amid lending suspension SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- Outstanding household loans from South Korea&#x27;s major banks recorded the first monthly decline in 11 months in December, industry sources said Friday. Total outstanding household loans from the country&#x27;s five major banks -- KB Kookmin, Woori, Hana, Shinhan and NH Nonghyup -- stood at 767.6 trillion won (USD$531.6 billion) as of end-December, down 456.3 billion won from the previous month. It marks the first monthly decline since last January, when the figure fell by 476.2 billion won from a month earlier, according to the sources. The drop came as major banks had suspended new household loans late last year, in line with the government&#x27;s efforts to cool down an overheated property market and curb household lending.
