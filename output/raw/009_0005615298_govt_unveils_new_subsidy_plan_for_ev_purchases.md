# Gov’t unveils new subsidy plan for EV purchases

The South Korean government on Thursday unveiled a comprehensive overhaul of its electric vehicle (EV) subsidy program for 2026, introducing new cash incentives for drivers replacing an internal combustion vehicle with an EV.The Ministry of Climate, Energy and Environment announced a reform plan on Thursday and began a public consultation process.Under the proposal, consumers who scrap or replace a combustion engine vehicle at least three years old with a new electric car will qualify for a conversion subsidy of up to 1 million won ($691).The ministry noted that the conversion bonus will not apply to vehicle transfers between close family members. For buyers of vehicles receiving a base subsidy of more than 5 million won, the full 1 million won bonus will be granted; for smaller base subsidies, the conversion amount will be proportionally lower.In a departure from recent policy, the government will freeze the per-vehicle subsidy cap at current levels, halting a planned annual reduction of 1 million won.Medium and large electric passenger cars remain eligible for up to 5.8 million won, while small models can receive up to 5.3 million won.A key pillar of the reform involves stricter battery efficiency and energy density requirements.Industry analysts say the new standards are likely to reduce payouts for models equipped with lower-density batteries, such as Tesla’s Model Y and BYD’s ATTO 3.As part of its effort to ensure the integrity of the program, the ministry stated that manufacturers and importers must now pass an evaluation of their “contribution to a sustainable domestic EV ecosystem” to participate.The measure is designed to prevent companies from accessing public funds without investing in local infrastructure or long-term service support.
