Samsung Electronics Co. has decided to keep prices unchanged for its flagship Galaxy S26 smartphone lineup, set to be released in March.According to industry sources on Thursday, the company plans to set the launch prices of all Galaxy S26 models at the same level as the predecessor Galaxy S25 series, marking the fourth consecutive year of price freezes.Under the plan, the Galaxy S26 base model will be priced at $799, the S26 Plus at $999, and the S26 Ultra at $1,299.Prices in South Korea may vary depending on exchange rates, but are expected to remain in line with the Galaxy S25 series. That would put the domestic prices at about 1.15 million won ($798.2) for the base model, 1.35 million won for the Plus, and 1.7 million won for the Ultra.Samsung is also reportedly planning to effectively freeze prices for its foldable series scheduled for release in July.If finalized, the Galaxy Fold 8 would be priced at $1,999, the same as the previous Fold 7, while the Galaxy Flip 8 would sell for $1,099.While prices for flagship models will remain flat, Samsung plans to raise prices on some models in its cost-effective Galaxy A series.The strategy appears to be aimed at minimizing consumer backlash by freezing flagship prices, while protecting profitability through price increases in mid- to low-range products.The industry had widely expected Samsung to raise prices due to higher component costs and the weaker Korean won.However, the company opted to maintain current pricing, concerned that price increases could erode market share amid intensifying competition from Apple Inc. and Chinese smartphone makers.
