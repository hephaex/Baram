While the use of cards and digital payment services continues to rise, cash spending has steadily declined in South Korea, even as the amount of cash kept at home or in offices has increased, driven by growing demand for emergency funds amid falling interest rates and heightened economic uncertainty.According to the Bank of Korea on Sunday, individuals’ average monthly cash spending stood at 324,000 won ($225), down 36 percent from 506,000 won in 2021. Cash accounted for 17.4 percent of total monthly spending, down 4.2 percentage points from four years earlier and lower than during the COVID-19 period.As cards and various digital payment services have become everyday payment tools, cash spending has steadily declined over the past decade. Average monthly cash spending fell 60 percent from 808,000 won in 2015, while cash’s share of total spending dropped from 38.8 percent to about half that level.However, cash usage remains higher among older and lower-income groups. Cash accounted for 20.8 percent of spending among people in their 60s and 32.4 percent among those aged 70 or older. For households earning less than 1 million won a month, the share rose to 59.4 percent.Despite reduced usage, cash holdings increased. The average amount of transaction cash carried per person rose to 103,000 won, up 25.6 percent from 2021. Emergency cash holdings averaged 541,000 won, a 52.8 percent increase over four years.Among survey respondents, 42.9 percent said they would reduce cash holdings if deposit rates rise, while 42.8 percent said they would increase cash holdings if economic uncertainty grows. The central bank said interest-rate movements and uncertainty are having a significant impact on cash demand.Companies showed similar patterns. Average monthly corporate cash spending fell to about 1.13 million won, while cash holdings more than doubled to 9.78 million won, largely due to precautionary liquidity needs.Opposition to a cashless society remained strong, with 45.8 percent of individuals opposed, far outweighing those in favor (17.7 percent). Major concerns included inconvenience for financially vulnerable groups and difficulty conducting transactions in emergencies.
