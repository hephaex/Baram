Lotte Chemical, the first in the industry to submit a petrochemical restructuring plan, is accelerating the upgrade of its business portfolio toward high-value specialty materials.The company said Sunday that the Lotte Engineering Plastics plant it established in Yulchon, South Jeolla Province, has begun commercial production on some lines as part of efforts to strengthen competitiveness in high-value specialty materials.Scheduled for completion in the second half of next year, the plant will be the country’s largest single compound production base with annual capacity of 500,000 tons. It will supply customized, high-performance materials for key industries such as mobility and information technology. Lotte Chemical is also expanding equipment in advance so the site can produce high-value super engineering plastics based on its technology capabilities.In battery materials, subsidiary Lotte Energy Materials is supplying core materials to domestic battery and energy storage systems, artificial intelligence, and semiconductor industries, leveraging its high-end copper foil and next-generation battery material technologies.In Ulsan, the company has begun commercial operation of a 20-MW hydrogen fuel-cell power plant since June through joint venture Lotte SK Eneroot. At the Daesan petrochemical complex, the nation’s largest high-pressure hydrogen shipping center is currently in operation.Lotte Chemical is also contributing to strengthening Korea’s semiconductor competitiveness. It is expanding production facilities at Hantok Chemicals, the world’s No. 1 semiconductor photoresist maker jointly operated with Japan’s Tokuyama. A new plant in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi Province, is scheduled to begin operations by the end of next year.Alongside the portfolio shift, Lotte Chemical is integrating and scaling back naphtha cracking center (NCC) facilities, centered on Chungnam’s Daesan and South Jeolla’s Yeosu.
