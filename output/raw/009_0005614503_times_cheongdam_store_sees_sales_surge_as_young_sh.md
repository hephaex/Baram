TIME, South Korea’s premier women’s fashion brand, is accelerating its push to become a global luxury label by attracting foreign customers and young shoppers in their 20s and 30s through its flagship store in Cheongdam-dong, southern Seoul.Handsome, a fashion company under Hyundai Department Store Group, announced on Tuesday that sales at the TIME flagship store, which opened on November 7, exceeded targets by more than 20 percent.It is unusual for a domestic women’s fashion brand to open a standalone flagship store on Cheongdam’s luxury shopping street. The store has delivered better-than-expected results since opening.Observers noted that the TIME flagship store is being used as a testbed for expanding overseas sales.The store’s popularity has been driven largely by customers in their 20s and 30s and by foreign visitors.The share of sales from customers aged 20-39 is 1.5 times higher than at TIME’s store in The Hyundai Seoul.Foreigners account for around 20 percent of total sales, significantly higher than TIME’s overall foreign sales share, which is estimated to be just over 10 percent.By nationality, Chinese customers make up the largest group, followed by Indonesians and Japanese.“TIME’s 30 years of accumulated heritage have been embodied in the space itself, making the flagship store a must-visit destination among loyal customers,” said an official from Handsome. “Many visitors come out of curiosity about the Cheongdam flagship store and end up purchasing TIME Paris products.”TIME Paris is the brand’s premium line named after collections showcased at Paris Fashion Week.In April, Handsome also opened the first TIME Paris store at The Hyundai Seoul.Handsome aims to expand TIME’s annual sales to around 500 billion won ($347 million) by 2030 and nurture it into a global premium brand. TIME became the first domestic women’s fashion brand to surpass 200 billion won in sales in 2016 and grew to 370 billion won in 2022.This year, sales are expected to remain at around 300 billion won due to high inflation and economic slowdown, but the brand believes growth potential remains strong as overseas sales continue to rise rapidly.The brand’s strategy focuses heavily on international prestige. TIME has already made waves in France, most notably becoming the first Korean women’s brand to host a pop-up at La Samaritaine, a landmark department store operated by the LVMH Group.The space has previously hosted pop-ups by global luxury brands such as Celine and Prada.
