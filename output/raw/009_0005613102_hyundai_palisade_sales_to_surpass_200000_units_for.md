Hyundai Motor Group’s bet on a multi-powertrain strategy is gaining traction amid a temporary slowdown in electric vehicle (EV) demand.According to Hyundai Motor on Sunday, global sales of the Hyundai Palisade reached 192,285 units in the first 11 months of this year, surpassing the previous record of 166,622 units in 2023.Driven by the popularity of hybrid models, the Palisade has achieved its highest-ever sales since launch and is expected to exceed 200,000 units on a full-year basis for the first time.First launched in 2018, Palisade sales have shown steady growth – 107,514 units in 2019, 157,133 units in 2020, and 157,688 units in 2021.Sales dipped slightly to 151,427 units in 2022, but after Hyundai introduced the first facelifted version, The New Palisade, that year, sales rebounded in 2023, rising 10 percent on year to 166,622 units.This year marks the launch of The All-New Palisade, a full model change released six years after the original debut in 2018.The model offers expanded interior space with seven- or nine-seat configurations and introduces Hyundai’s next-generation hybrid system, paired with a 2.5-liter turbocharged gasoline engine.The hybrid version features driving-focused technologies such as e-Ride and e-Handling, which use the electric motor to improve ride comfort and handling performance, appealing to consumers seeking efficiency without sacrificing driving dynamics.Hyundai Motor is continuing to expand its hybrid lineup with the Palisade at the forefront.At its CEO Investor Day in September, the company announced plans to expand its hybrid vehicle lineup – benefitting from the EV demand slowdown – to 18 models by 2030, spanning entry-level, mid-size, large, and luxury segments.“The Palisade has become one of Hyundai’s flagship SUVs, gaining popularity amid rising leisure activities and growing demand for spacious interiors,” said an official from Hyundai Motor. “Hybrid models with high fuel efficiency and strong performance are contributing significantly to the increase in Palisade sales.”
