South Korea’s retail sales fell sharply in November, snapping a two-month rebound, while industrial production and investment posted modest gains, highlighting an uneven recovery in domestic demand.According to data released by the Ministry of Data and Statistics on Tuesday, the country’s overall industrial output rose 0.9 percent to 113.7 in November from a month earlier.Industrial production has fluctuated on a monthly basis, falling 0.3 percent in August, gaining 1.3 percent in September, and declining 2.7 percent in October.The increase was led by mining and manufacturing output, which climbed 0.6 percent, driven largely by a 7.5 percent surge in semiconductor production as exports improved and output recovered from a steep decline a month earlier.Production of electronic components also rose 5 percent, supported by new product launches, including Samsung Electronics Co.’s Galaxy Z Flip, the statistics office said.Consumption indicators, on the other hand, weakened as temporary factors such as the Chuseok holiday faded.Retail sales fell 3.3 percent in November from October, the steepest monthly decline in nearly two years, marking the first drop in two months.Sales of non-durable goods such as food and beverages fell 4.3 percent.Wholesale and retail trade output declined 1.6 percent for a second straight month, with wholesale activity down 2.4 percent.Investment showed tentative improvement.Facility investment rose 1.5 percent month-on-month, supported by machinery purchases, while construction output increased 6.6 percent, led by building activity.However, construction orders fell 9.2 percent from a year earlier, signaling continued weakness ahead.The cyclical component of the coincident composite index, a gauge of current economic conditions, fell 0.4 point from the previous month, marking a negative reading for the second consecutive month.The cyclical component of the leading composite index, which predicts future economic conditions, rose 0.3 point from the previous month, data showed.
