(LEAD) KT data breach-investigation result(LEAD) Gov&#x27;t says poor security of femtocells led to major payment breach at KT(ATTN: ADDS more details in paras 12-16; CHANGES photos)By Kang Yoon-seung SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- The science ministry said Monday the security breach at KT Corp. that led to a series of unauthorized mobile payments this year was caused by the mobile carrier&#x27;s poor management of femtocells, small base stations designed for use in homes or businesses. The Ministry of Science and ICT released the investigation report after the country&#x27;s No. 2 mobile carrier reported a security breach that led to unauthorized micropayments totaling 243 million won (US$169,000) and affecting 368 users. The number of users whose mobile numbers, International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) numbers were compromised came to 22,227. &quot;The investigation team confirmed that KT&#x27;s overall management system for femtocells was inadequate, making it easy for illegal femtocells to access KT&#x27;s internal network,&quot; the ministry said in a release. In detail, the ministry said femtocells supplied to KT all shared identical certificates, allowing unauthorized products to access the internal network. The investigation showed 94 KT servers were infected with 103 types of malware.

&quot;With the expiration period of KT certificates set at 10 years, femtocells that had accessed the KT network even once could continue to gain access,&quot; it added. The ministry requested KT to take measures to prevent a recurrence of similar incidents, including regularly changing the authentication server&#x27;s IP address and establishing systems to detect and block access attempts by unauthorized femtocells. Based on the investigation, the ministry plans to order KT to submit detailed measures to prevent a recurrence of such incidents within the next month and follow up in June on whether the mobile carrier implemented the plan. The ministry noted that because KT failed to fulfill its contractual obligations, it is possible to ask mobile carriers to waive cancellation fees for users who wish to unsubscribe. &quot;We have determined KT has not fulfilled its duty to provide secure telecommunication services to all users due to its poor management of femtocell security,&quot; it added. During a press briefing, Second Vice Science Minister Ryu Je-myung said that while some of the tactics used by the hackers in the KT case were similar to those in another data breach at SK Telecom Co., there was no evidence that the attacks were carried out by the same suspects. &quot;There were some similarities in the two companies&#x27; cases, but we have concluded that we cannot determine whether the attackers were identical,&quot; Ryu said. He added that the government expects KT to make a reasonable decision in determining the scope of users eligible for the cancellation-fee waiver. In response to the investigation results, KT said it will notify users of the details of its compensation in the near future. &quot;We accept the investigation results of the joint government-private sector probe in a serious manner. We plan to promptly announce the details of customer compensation and measures to improve information security as soon as they are confirmed,&quot; the company said.

Regarding a separate data breach case at LG Uplus Corp., first reported in July, the ministry said the No. 3 mobile carrier had filed false documents and discarded affected servers, rendering any investigation impossible. The ministry said it has asked the police to investigate LG Uplus on suspicions of obstructing official duties, considering that its reinstallation or discarding of server operating systems took place after the Korea Internet &amp; Security Agency notified the company of the breach in July. &quot;Businesses need to recognize that establishing a reliable and safe service environment is essential for their survival and must place information security as their top priority,&quot; Science Minister Bae Kyung-hoon said in the release. &quot;The government will continue efforts to enhance the country&#x27;s information security capacity in line with its goal of becoming one of the world&#x27;s top three artificial intelligence powerhouses.&quot; colin@yna.co.kr(END)
