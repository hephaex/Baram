Coupang-data leak Nat&#x27;l Assembly set for 2-day hearing over Coupang&#x27;s massive data leakBy Chae Yun-hwan SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- The National Assembly was set to open a two-day parliamentary hearing Tuesday to inspect Coupang over the online retailer&#x27;s massive data leak that affected nearly two-thirds of South Korea&#x27;s population. The hearing will involve six parliamentary committees, including the science and ICT committee, to examine the breach and the company&#x27;s alleged unfair business practices, with 13 current and former executives selected as witnesses. Coupang founder Kim Bom-suk, his brother and company Vice President Yoo Kim, and Kang Han-seung, the former CEO of Coupang&#x27;s Korea unit, however, have submitted statements informing the Assembly of their absence. The main opposition People Power Party, which has called for a parliamentary inspection into the company instead of a hearing, has decided to boycott the hearing. Last month, Coupang confirmed that the personal information of 33.7 million customer accounts had been exposed, noting the compromised data included users&#x27; names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery addresses. A police investigation into the massive data leak is currently under way.
