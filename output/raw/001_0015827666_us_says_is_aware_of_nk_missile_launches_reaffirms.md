US military-NK missilesU.S. says is aware of N.K. missile launches, reaffirms defense commitment to alliesBy Song Sang-ho WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (Yonhap) -- A U.S. military command said Saturday it is aware of North Korea&#x27;s missile launches this week while reaffirming its security commitment to allies in the region. The Indo-Pacific Command issued a statement after Pyongyang lobbed multiple ballistic missiles toward the East Sea on Sunday morning (Korea time), marking its first missile test this year. &quot;We are aware of the missile launches and are consulting closely with our allies and partners. Based on current assessments, this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel or territory, or to our allies,&quot; the command said. &quot;The United States remains committed to the defense of the U.S. homeland and our allies in the region,&quot; it added. The North&#x27;s latest launches came as South Korean President Lee Jae Myung plans to have a summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing during his four-day state visit to China this week. They also followed U.S. President Donald Trump&#x27;s announcement that the U.S. has captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a military strike in Caracas to bring him to face American justice for drug trafficking and other charges.
