Korean series-Netflix ranking&#x27;Culinary Class Wars&#x27; Season 2, &#x27;The Great Flood&#x27; reign atop Netflix charts for second week SEOUL, Dec. 31 (Yonhap) -- &quot;Culinary Class Wars: Season 2&quot; topped Netflix&#x27;s weekly non-English series chart for the second consecutive week, the streaming service said Wednesday. The hit cooking competition, released Dec. 16, topped the category with 4.7 million views for the week ending Dec. 28, according to data from Netflix&#x27;s official site Tudum. The latest installment features top culinary figures, including Michelin-starred chefs Lee Joon and Son Jong-won, and Ven. Seon-jae, celebrated for her mastery of Buddhist temple cuisine, competing in intense competitions. Four other Korean series made the top 10. Netflix&#x27;s original &quot;Cashero,&quot; featuring Lee Jun-ho as a civil servant with supernatural powers, debuted at No. 2 with 3.8 million views, while the romantic comedy &quot;Dynamite Kiss,&quot; starring Ahn Eun-jin and Jang Ki-yong, secured No. 3 with 3.3 million views. ENA&#x27;s rom-com &quot;I Dol I&quot; came in at No. 6 with 2.1 million views, and the crime thriller &quot;The Price of Confession,&quot; starring Jeon Do-yeon and Kim Go-eun, landed at No. 9 with 1.7 million views.

Meanwhile, &quot;The Great Flood,&quot; released Dec. 19, retained the No. 1 spot for a second straight week on the service&#x27;s non-English movies chart for the same period. Directed by Kim Byung-woo, the sci-fi disaster film garnered 33.1 million views, up from last week&#x27;s 27.9 million views, far surpassing the Mexican action comedy &quot;A Time for Bravery,&quot; which came in at No. 2 with 8.2 million views. The film depicts the struggles of An-na, played by Kim Da-mi, a single mother of a 6-year-old son who suddenly wakes up in the middle of a devastating flood that engulfs her apartment complex and, by extension, the planet. She fights to protect her young son as she navigates the inundated building.
