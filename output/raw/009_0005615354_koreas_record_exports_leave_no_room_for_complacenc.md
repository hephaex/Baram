# Korea’s record exports leave no room for complacency

South Korea’s exports topped $700 billion for the first time in 2025, posting an all-time high. Semiconductors drove the surge, while automobiles, shipbuilding, bio-health products and cosmetics also delivered solid gains.The milestone is notable given persistent headwinds such as tariff pressure and global oversupply, and it reflects the competitiveness of Korean industry and sustained corporate innovation.However, it must not be overlooked that despite these achievements, the public’s perception of the economy remains bleak.According to the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy’s annual export and import trends, released Thursday, exports reached $709.7 billion in 2025, up 3.8 percent from a year earlier.Semiconductor exports jumped 22.2 percent to $173.4 billion, buoyed by expanding global investment in artificial intelligence and data centers.Automobile exports fell to the United States, Korea’s largest market, but overall growth was supported by stronger demand for eco-friendly vehicles and used cars, along with broader export diversification to the European Union and the Commonwealth of Independent States.The disconnect lies in the domestic economy.Survey results show that roughly half of Koreans expect economic conditions to worsen this year compared with last year. Despite robust export performance, the spillover into domestic investment and job creation has been limited, as corporate spending has increasingly flowed overseas.The virtuous cycle in which export growth fuels small businesses and regional economies has weakened. Elevated living costs, coupled with a weak currency and high interest rates, have further restrained private consumption, making a recovery in domestic demand harder to achieve.Under these circumstances, continued export growth alone is unlikely to improve how households experience the economy. More decisive steps are needed to ensure that export gains translate into domestic investment and employment.That will be difficult without reforms to labor and tax policies that deter investment at home and abroad. At the same time, the government should continue efforts to ease household cost pressures through price and exchange-rate stability, while exploring ways to revive traditional domestic-demand sectors such as construction, wholesale and retail, and accommodation.The government should not be satisfied merely with the achievement of $700 billion in exports. Export growth only becomes meaningful when it leads to tangible improvements in people’s quality of life.
