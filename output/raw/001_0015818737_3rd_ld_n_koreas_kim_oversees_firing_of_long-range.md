(3rd LD) N Korea-missile (3rd LD) N. Korea&#x27;s Kim oversees firing of long-range strategic cruise missiles (ATTN: UPDATES with details throughout; RECASTS headline, lead para)By Kim Soo-yeon SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has overseen launches of long-range strategic cruise missiles, calling for the &quot;unlimited and sustained&quot; development of state nuclear combat forces, state media reported Monday. The missile tests came days after Kim inspected an 8,700-ton &quot;nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine&quot; under construction in a show of military prowess. The missile launching drills took place Sunday in the Yellow Sea, demonstrating &quot;the absolute reliability and combat readiness of the North&#x27;s strategic counterattack capability,&quot; according to the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The strategic cruise missiles flew along the preset flight orbit for 10,199 seconds and 10,203 seconds to hit a target, it said, without disclosing the flight distance.

Kim affirmed that North Korea would &quot;as ever devote all their efforts to the unlimited and sustained development of the state nuclear combat force,&quot; the KCNA said. He stressed the importance of checking the reliability and rapid response of components of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear deterrent on a regular basis as Pyongyang is facing various security threats, it said. The South Korean military said it detected the launch of multiple missiles from the Sunan area near Pyongyang at around 8 a.m. the previous day, noting that North Korea may conduct additional missile tests around the end of the year. The latest missile launch came ahead of next year&#x27;s key party congress, as the North&#x27;s leader has ramped up his inspections of military-related sites in an apparent bid to tout the country&#x27;s accomplishments in the defense sector. Last week, the North unveiled the hull of a nuclear-powered submarine under development, with Kim warning that South Korea&#x27;s plan to build a nuclear-powered sub will be a threat to the North&#x27;s security that &quot;must be countered.&quot; He also inspected the test-firing of new long-range anti-air missiles in the East Sea on Wednesday. Hong Min, a senior researcher at South Korea&#x27;s Korea Institute for National Unification, said the missile launched Sunday appears to be the upgraded version of the Hwasal-1 cruise missile. Seoul&#x27;s defense ministry denounced a series of North Korea&#x27;s military moves as acts that threaten peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. &quot;North Korea should respond to South Korea&#x27;s efforts to resume dialogue that are being made in good faith to promote peace and coexistence on the peninsula and join efforts to maintain the stable situation,&quot; Chung Binna, ministry spokesperson, told a press briefing.
