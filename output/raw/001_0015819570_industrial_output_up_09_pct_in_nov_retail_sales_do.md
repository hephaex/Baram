industrial output-tallyIndustrial output up 0.9 pct in Nov.; retail sales down 3.3 pct By Kim Han-joo SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- South Korea&#x27;s industrial output grew from a month earlier in November, driven by robust semiconductor production, while retail sales declined after a brief rebound in the previous month, government data showed Tuesday. Industrial production gained 0.9 percent on-month in November, according to the data from the Ministry of Data and Statistics. Retail sales, a gauge of private spending, went down 3.3 percent over the cited period. Facility investment rose 1.5 percent, led by increased investment in machinery.
