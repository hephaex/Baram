KT Corp. will waive early termination fees for all customers through Jan. 13 next year and roll out a 450 billion won ($315 million) compensation package, acknowledging responsibility for unauthorized micro-payment incidents and a hacking breach.KT announced the measures Tuesday at a press briefing held at its Gwanghwamun headquarters in Seoul, offering a public apology and outlining fee waivers, customer reward programs and sweeping information-security reforms. Chief Executive Kim Young-shub said the company “deeply apologizes to customers harmed by the breach” and vowed to take “all possible steps” to restore trust following the findings of a joint public-private investigation.The fee waiver applies to customers who cancel mobile service contracts between Dec. 31 this year and Jan. 13 next year, and will be retroactively extended to those who terminated service between Sept. 1 and Dec. 30. Exclusions apply to customers who newly signed up, changed devices or renewed contracts after Sept. 1, as well as MVNO users, IoT lines and administrative terminations. Refunds will be processed by application from Jan. 14 to Jan. 31 via KT’s website, customer centers and retail stores.After the waiver period ends, KT will run a six-month customer rewards program starting in February. Benefits include an automatic 100 GB of data per month, a 50 percent boost to roaming data, and a six-month pass to one of two OTT services. KT will also offer six months of membership discounts with everyday partners such as coffee shops, cinemas and bakeries. In addition, a two-year safety insurance plan covering phishing, hacking and online or secondhand-market fraud will be provided, with customers aged 65 and over enrolled automatically.Industry sources estimate that about 17,000 customers have left KT for rival carriers since Sept. 8. SK telecom, which previously offered fee waivers after a similar hacking incident, has said such measures cost roughly 100,000 won per customer, implying KT’s waiver alone could exceed 1.7 billion won.To prevent a recurrence, KT said it will launch a companywide information-security innovation task force and tighten controls across networks, servers and the supply chain. The carrier will also expand privacy audits and strengthen accountability under its chief information security officer, with regular reviews and reporting at the board and executive levels.
