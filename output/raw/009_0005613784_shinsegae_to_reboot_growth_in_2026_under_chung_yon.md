Shinsegae Group is overhauling its offline, online and global business strategies to reignite growth momentum, with Chairman Chung Yong-jin declaring 2026 the year the group returns to expansion mode.In a New Year’s address on Monday, Chung said the group had completed preparations for a new leap forward, calling on executives to embrace bold innovation rooted in what he described as the group’s “top-tier instinct.” He stressed that Shinsegae must go beyond incremental improvements and fundamentally rethink strategies, rules and even customer demand itself.As part of the renewed push, Emart plans to roll out what it calls an “overwhelming No.1 strategy” next year, strengthening store and product competitiveness through major renovations. The Yangjae store is set to reopen in March, followed by the Eunpyeong store in April. Emart also plans to increase large-scale discount events to once a month to secure greater pricing leadership.Online grocery platform SSG.com will sharpen its identity around Emart’s strengths, launching a new membership program in January that offers a fixed 7 percent reward on grocery purchases to attract and retain loyal customers.Meanwhile, Gmarket under Emart is accelerating its overseas expansion, with plans to extend operations into Europe and the Americas next year. The company said it aims to provide the easiest and most scalable pathway for Korean sellers to enter global markets.Chung said decisions executed through 2025 were all part of preparing for a bigger leap, adding that the time has come to act decisively and move faster than competitors amid rapid changes in the retail landscape.
