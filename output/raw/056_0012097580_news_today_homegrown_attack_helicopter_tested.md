[LEAD]Korea is developing an amphibious attack helicopter using its own technology.Designed to support Marine landings from the air, the aircraft is seen as essential for a country surrounded by seas and islands.With development set for completion this summer, testing is now in full swing.Let&#x27;s take a look.[REPORT]A helicopter glides over the East Sea toward the rising morning sun.This is an amphibious attack helicopter currently being developed using homegrown technology.Based on the Marine Corps’ existing Marineon helicopter,it has been upgraded to carry a rotary machine gun, guided and unguided rockets, as well as air-to-ground and air-to-air missiles.It can provide cover for troops landing in enemy territory, engage enemy forces in the air, and strike ground targets.Yoon Jin / KBS reporterAfter a successful maiden flight a year ago, the helicopter has since undergone flight tests at various times of day, reaffirming flight stability.The model also passed live-fire test evaluations conducted last year.Following daytime and nighttime machine-gun tests and rocket firing tests,it also successfully completed trials in which rockets were guided to hit targets based on information sent from ground units or independently acquired by the helicopter, thereby proving its combat capability.Lee Da-bin / Marine Corps CommandThis secures core combat power for wartime multi-dimensional amphibious operations and strengthens an aggressive defense posture for the strategically critical frontline northwestern islands in peacetime.As the upgraded version shares many components with Marineon, pilot training and logistical support are also easier.Park Sang-ho / Korea Aerospace IndustriesThe automatic navigation system is very well developed.As a result, its weapon accuracy is significantly higher than that of other attack helicopters.The Korean military will complete the development of the amphibious attack helicopter by August this year and plans to mass-produce 24 units for deployment.■ 제보하기▷ 전화 : 02-781-1234, 4444▷ 이메일 : kbs1234@kbs.co.kr▷ 카카오톡 : &#x27;KBS제보&#x27; 검색, 채널 추가▷ 네이버, 유튜브에서 KBS뉴스를 구독해주세요!
