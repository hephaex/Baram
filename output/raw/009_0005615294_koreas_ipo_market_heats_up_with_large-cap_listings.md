# Korea’s IPO market heats up with large-cap listings

South Korea’s initial public offering (IPO) market is set to see a wave of large-cap listings this year, riding an unprecedented stock market rally.According to the financial investment industry on Thursday, Essex Solutions Inc., which filed for a preliminary listing review in November, is widely viewed as a leading candidate for the first IPO on the benchmark Kospi this year.Founded in the United States in 1930 and acquired by LS Group in 2008, the wire and cable solutions company was valued at about $1 billion in a pre-IPO transaction at the end of 2024.Another contender is internet-only lender Kbank, which also submitted a preliminary review application in November.The listing would mark the company’s third attempt to go public after failed bids in 2022 and 2024. Market participants expect Kbank to lower its targeted valuation to around 4 trillion won ($2.77 billion), from about 5 trillion won previously, to ensure a successful listing.The outlook for these deals may hinge on how regulators address so-called overlapping listings of parent companies and their subsidiaries.The Korea Exchange has begun drafting guidelines aimed at clarifying listing standards, with revisions to detailed rules expected in the first quarter.The outcome is expected to influence a broader group of large corporate subsidiaries preparing for IPOs.Hanwha Energy Corp. and SK ecoplant Co. have selected lead underwriters and are considering applications for preliminary reviews, while HD Hyundai Robotics has begun the process of appointing underwriters.Several high-profile startups are also moving toward public listings.Piece Peace Studio, which operates the fashion brand Mardi Mercredi, has filed for a preliminary review. Fashion platform Musinsa has completed the selection of its IPO underwriters and was valued at around 4 trillion won when EQT Partners acquired existing shares in April last year.Cosmetics and beauty company Gudai Global Inc. has sent out requests for proposals as it prepares to select underwriters.As large-cap offerings line up, analysts expect investor scrutiny to intensify following tighter lock-up requirements for institutional investors.According to the investment banking industry, the average lock-up commitment ratio in IPOs rose to 18.8 percent last year, nearly triple the 6.5 percent recorded a year earlier, after rules introduced in July required 30 percent of institutional allocations to be preferentially assigned to investors agreeing to lock-ups.Since the new book-building system, the average lock-up ratio for 234 newly listed companies has climbed to 40.7 percent. Beginning this year, the preferential allocation threshold will be raised to 40 percent, a shift that market participants say could widen differences in demand across issuers.The first IPO this year to fall under the strengthened rules is Deokyang Energen, a producer of high-purity industrial hydrogen.The company is scheduled to conduct institutional demand forecasting from January 12 to 16. At the top of the indicated range, the offering is expected to raise 75 billion won, implying a market capitalization of about 254 billion won.
