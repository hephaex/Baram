Yim Jong-yong, chairman of Woori Financial Group, is set to serve a second term after he was nominated as the final candidate on Monday.Woori Financial announced on Monday that its executive candidate recommendation committee recommended the incumbent chairman Yim as the next chairman.Pending approval at the shareholders’ meeting in March 2026, Yim will officially assume his new term as chairman, which will run until March 2029.Lee Kang-haeng, head of the nomination committee, noted that during his tenure, “Yim successfully entered the securities business and acquired insurance companies, completing the portfolio of a comprehensive financial group.”“He also narrowed the gap in common equity tier 1 capital ratios, which had lagged behind other groups, thereby improving financial stability.”Since Yim took the helm, Woori Financial has launched a securities arm and acquired insurance companies such as Tongyang Life Insurance and ABL Life Insurance, building a well-rounded comprehensive financial portfolio.“His active shareholder return policies, which more than doubled the group’s market capitalization, were also highly evaluated by committee members,” Lee added.In a statement, Yim vowed “to continue to develop Woori Financial into a comprehensive financial group capable of generating strong synergies, building on the strengthened portfolio through our expansion into securities and insurance.”
