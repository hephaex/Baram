stock market-annual closingKOSPI closes 2025 with over 75 pct return, best since dot-com bubble: data SEOUL, Dec. 30 (Yonhap) -- South Korea&#x27;s benchmark stock index closed off more than 70 percent higher compared to the start of the year, recording the highest return since the dot-com bubble, data showed Tuesday. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) closed at 4,214.17 on the last trading day of this year, up 75.7 percent compared to Jan. 2, when the index finished at 2,398.94, according to the data from Yonhap Infomax, the financial arm of Yonhap News Agency. It marks the highest rate of growth since 1999 when the index rose 83 percent just before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. Analysts predicted the KOSPI to continue its bull run in 2026, citing ample global liquidity and the government&#x27;s stock market boosting measures. But persisting woes regarding the profitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-related investments and uncertainties over the Federal Reserve&#x27;s policy direction in the United States remain as risk factors, they added. &quot;The Fed&#x27;s monetary easing cycle could end around the early half of next year. The possibility that market volatility could increase in the second half of next year is still open,&quot; Kim Jong-min, an analyst at Samsung Securities, said in a report. South Korea&#x27;s 11 major brokerages have predicted the KOSPI to fall within the range of 3,500 to 5,500 next year. The highest KOSPI outlook came from NH Investment &amp; Securities, which forecast the benchmark index to reach between 4,000 and 5,500. Hana Securities issued the lowest forecast, setting its KOSPI target in the 3,750-4,300 range.
