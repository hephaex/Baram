S Korea-UN command-military U.N. Command says military boundary between two Koreas under its authorityBy Kim Hyun-soo SEOUL, Dec. 28 (Yonhap) -- The American-led United Nations Command (UNC) has said a Military Demarcation Line (MDL) marking the boundary between the two Koreas has been under its authority, in an apparent objection to an internal revision by South Korea&#x27;s military over land border rules to prevent accidental clashes with North Korea. The UNC said in statement to Yonhap News Agency, &quot;The United Nations Command reaffirms its commitment to maintaining the Armistice Agreement, including the MDL, and to supporting measures that prevent escalation and promote stability within the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).&quot; The statement came when asked how the UNC assessed the South Korean military&#x27;s envisioned revision of border rules, after the Korean military reportedly refined the MDL markers in order to reduce discrepancies between the two sides. &quot;The Military Demarcation Line was established and depicted in Map Volume I of the Korean Armistice Agreement on July 27, 1953, following a series of armistice negotiations,&quot; the UNC said. Last week, South Korea&#x27;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said it had ordered troops to prioritize markers that indicate the MDL when making decisions, while also &quot;comprehensively&quot; applying the South Korean military map and a line connecting MDL markers set out by the UNC when they are difficult to discern. Critics say the move favors North Korean troops by allowing the military to use a line drawn farther south when determining whether a border crossing has occurred.

On Seoul&#x27;s recent proposal for military talks with Pyongyang, the UNC stressed that military dialogue related to the MDL should be conducted &quot;under the auspices of the command,&quot; as stipulated in the armistice agreement. South Korea proposed holding military talks with North Korea last month to clarify the military demarcation line, as the number of North Korean soldiers crossing the MDL while working near the border has surged in recent months. The U.S.-led multinational force declined to comment on whether Pyongyang has responded to the proposal, citing the need to preserve the integrity of communications. sookim@yna.co.kr(END)
