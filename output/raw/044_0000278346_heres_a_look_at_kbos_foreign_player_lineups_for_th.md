With the Korean Baseball League&#x27;s 2026 season set to begin March 28, all 10 teams have now locked in their foreign player lineups, setting the stage for how the standings could shake out in the upcoming season.Here are some notable signings on the 2026 roster of foreign players.

James Naile (Kia Tigers)Top earners The highest-paid non-Korean set to play in the league next year is pitcher James Naile for the Kia Tigers. The 32-year-old has agreed to a one-year extension with the team, worth $2 million, including a $200,000 signing bonus, $1.6 million in salary and $200,000 in incentives.Naile was one of the KBO&#x27;s most reliable arms this season, going 8-4 with a 2.25 ERA over 27 starts, which was the league&#x27;s second best. He also logged a career high of 164 1/3 innings and 152 strikeouts.In his KBO debut season in 2024, the American led all qualified pitchers with a 2.53 ERA and played a key role in the Tigers’ successful Korean Series championship run.

Austin Dean (LG Twins)Another top earner is Austin Dean for the LG Twins. The reigning South Korean baseball champions have re-signed with the first baseman for one more season. The 32-year-old, who has been with the team since 2023, will earn $1.1 million in salary, $300,000 in incentives and $300,000 in a signing bonus.In 395 games across three seasons, the Texan has been one of the KBO’s most consistent sluggers, batting .315 with 464 hits, 86 homers and 322 RBIs. He led the league with 132 RBIs last year and won back-to-back Gold Gloves as the best overall player in his position.Freshmen of 2026 KBO season

Shota Takeda (SSG Landers)Starting next year, each team is allowed to add one Asian- or Australian-born player to its standard three foreign signings. The Asian quota players must have played in Asia or Australia the previous season, with total costs capped at $200,000, including salary and signing bonuses.Among the freshmen joining the KBO under the new quota is right-handed pitcher Shota Takeda, who signed with the SSG Landers. The 32-year-old Japanese player agreed to a one-year contract worth $200,000, bringing an end to his 12-year run with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball.

Sam Hilliard (KT Wiz)Known for his 44 career MLB home runs, Sam Hilliard is a new addition to the KT Wiz. He agreed to a one-year contract worth $1 million.Drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the 15th round in 2015, the 31-year-old American outfielder played in Colorado from 2019–22 and again in 2024–25, with a one-season stop with the Atlanta Braves in 2023.Other notable signings

He also hit .297 with two home runs and 14 RBIs in 41 games last season while playing in the Orix Buffaloes’ farm system.Notably, Dale&#x27;s baseball roots run deep.
