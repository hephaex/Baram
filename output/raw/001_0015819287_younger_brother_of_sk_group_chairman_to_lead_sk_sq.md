SK Group-vice chairmanYounger brother of SK Group chairman to lead SK Square in AI push SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- The younger brother of SK Group Chairman Chey Tae-won has been appointed to lead SK Square Co., the investment arm of the chip-to-energy conglomerate, in an apparent move to strengthen the company&#x27;s artificial intelligence (AI) and semiconductor capabilities, industry sources said Monday. Chey Jae-won, executive vice chairman of SK Innovation Co., will head SK Square along with President Kim Jung-kyu starting early next year, according to the sources. SK Square was spun off from SK Telecom Co. in 2021 and serves as an intermediate holding company, with chip giant SK hynix Inc. under its umbrella. Chey joined SKC Co., the group&#x27;s chemical materials unit, in 1994 and has worked at SK affiliates, including SK Telecom, SK Inc., and SK Innovation, for about 30 years. He was appointed executive vice chairman of SK Innovation last year to address the company&#x27;s sluggish battery business performance, particularly at its subsidiary SK On Co., amid a slowdown in the global electric vehicle market. Chey&#x27;s latest appointment came as SK Group has been reorganizing its business portfolio with a focus on AI and semiconductors. It also aligns with the group&#x27;s executive reshuffle conducted in October to accelerate restructuring efforts, which included leadership changes at key affiliates, such as SK Telecom. &quot;Chey&#x27;s deep understanding of advanced technology and experience are expected play a role in improving SK Square&#x27;s corporate value,&quot; a source said. &quot;He will support the new leadership established through the reshuffle.&quot;
