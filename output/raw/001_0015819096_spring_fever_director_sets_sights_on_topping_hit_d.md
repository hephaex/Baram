tvN series-press conference&#x27;Spring Fever&#x27; director sets sights on topping hit drama &#x27;Marry My Husband&#x27;By Woo Jae-yeon SEOUL, Dec. 29 (Yonhap) -- Director Park Won-guk on Monday expressed his hope that the upcoming romance series &quot;Spring Fever&quot; will surpass the popularity of his record-setting previous work &quot;Marry My Husband.&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t be satisfied with ordinary love anymore,&quot; the director joked at a press conference in Seoul. &quot;While preparing &#x27;Spring Fever,&#x27; I set my goal to receive even greater love than &#x27;Marry My Husband.&#x27;&quot; His earlier series for tvN, which aired from Jan. 2-Feb. 20 of last year, achieved a peak viewership of 12 percent, the highest for the cable channel&#x27;s Monday-Tuesday drama slot. Its popularity also led to a Japanese remake earlier this year.

Based on a web novel of the same name, the upcoming romance revolves around the budding relationship between Yoon Bom (Lee Ju-bin), a cool-headed teacher, and Seon Jae-gyu (Ahn Bo-hyun), a passionate man whose nephew attends the school where Bom teaches. Ahn portrays Jae-gyu, whose imposing physique and rough, tattoo-covered exterior hide a surprising charm and steadfast love. His world begins to sway as he falls for Bom. To prepare for the role, the actor said he bulked up by 4-5 kilograms, adding that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t easy because I had to do that in a short period of time.&quot; The director said the romance centers on a woman seeking an ordinary life and a man who is anything but. On Jae-gyu, the director explained that the character &quot;breaks conventional drama tropes and embodies what true coolness really is.&quot;

The series was filmed entirely in Pohang, some 270 kilometers southeast of Seoul, a coastal city that had already drawn visitors but saw renewed attention following the success of the 2021 tvN romance &quot;Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha&quot; which was also filmed there. Ahn, who is originally from Busan, said his natural use of the Gyeongsang dialect will make his portrayal of the Busan-native Jae-gyu feel relatable. &quot;I had always wanted to act using a dialect, and this drama gave me the chance to bring out my secret weapon,&quot; he said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to miss the opportunity to be part of the series and the role,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;Because the series was different in tone from the dramas I had done before, I thought if I did well, many viewers would tune in.&quot; Lee, best known for her role in &quot;Queen of Tears,&quot; said she was drawn to her character because of her unconventional personality and a narrative of her own. &quot;I think I can showcase a broad acting range,&quot; she said. The 12-part series is set for release next Monday. jaeyeon.woo@yna.co.kr(END)
