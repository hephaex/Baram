The museum, operated under the Seoul Museum of Art, is the first public museum devoted to positioning photography as a more accessible and widely appreciated art form.Together with the Buk-Seoul Museum of Art in Nowon-gu, a 10-minute drive from the photography museum, the two art institutes now create a cultural synergy in the northern Seoul neighborhoods. Spanning four floors above ground and two below, the museum holds more than 20,000 works of photographic art and archival materials, according to the museum.The ongoing exhibition “All That Photography” spans the history of contemporary photography in Korea from the 1960s to the 2010s, featuring work from 36 Korean artists.Korean Pavilion marks 30 years in Venice
