LG Display will showcase its highest-performance OLED panels for gaming monitors at CES 2026, the world’s largest IT and consumer electronics exhibition.The South Korean company said Sunday it will unveil a 27-inch gaming OLED panel featuring the industry’s highest refresh rate at 720Hz and a response time of 0.02 milliseconds at CES 2026, which opens Jan. 6 in Las Vegas. The refresh rate indicates how many times a screen updates per second, meaning a 720Hz panel refreshes the display 720 times a second. LG Display is the first to achieve such an ultra-high refresh rate in an OLED panel. The panel also delivers a response time more than 150 times faster than the average LCD panel.LG Display will also introduce the world’s first 39-inch 5K2K gaming OLED panel. The 39-inch OLED panel, which LG Display is the only company globally to mass-produce, offers ultra-high resolution surpassing UHD standards used by professional video creators. Combined with a 21:9 aspect ratio and a 1500R curved design, the panel is designed to deliver a highly immersive viewing experience.In addition, the company will showcase the world’s first OLED panel featuring a 240Hz RGB stripe pixel structure. Along with a 240Hz refresh rate for strong gaming performance, the panel achieves a pixel density of 160 pixels per inch, enabling precise and sharp graphic rendering.LG Display plans to apply its next-generation large OLED technology, dubbed “Primary RGB Tandem 2.0,” to all gaming OLED panels it launches in 2026.
