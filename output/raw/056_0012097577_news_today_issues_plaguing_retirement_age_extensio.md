[LEAD]One of the key issues set to take center stage in Korea this year is the extension of the retirement age.Who should work longer, how it should be structured, and how far it should extend remain open questions.With labor, management, and younger generations all approaching the issue from different angles, we look at the challenges ahead.[REPORT]Sixty-year-old Bae Tae-yong is a facility manager at an elderly care service company.He is no longer stressed about retirement after the company decided to extend the retirement age to sixty-six.Bae Tae-yong / Elderly care service company, facility management team headIf I can keep working, my life will stabilize.Fifteen percent of this company&#x27;s employees are in their sixties.Both the employees and management are satisfied, as workers can continue earning income before becoming eligible for the national pension, while the company retains experienced staff.Park Ki-taek / Elderly care service company, head of human resourcesThe retirement age is currently 66, but it may be extended further to make greater use of employees&#x27; know-how and experience.Last year, the ruling Democratic Party proposed legislation to extend the retirement age to sixty-five.The discussion is still ongoing.The labor sector wants the retirement age to be uniformly extended to sixty-five for all workers.Jeon Ho-il / Korea Confederation of Trade UnionsAs this issue is directly linked to workers&#x27; right to survive in old age, the retirement age extension must align with the pension eligibility age.In contrast, management is concerned about rising labor costs.Employers also question the plan&#x27;s effectiveness, arguing that the benefits would largely go to full-time workers at large corporations and in the public sector.Lim Yeong-tae / Korea Enterprises FederationCompanies would be forced to shoulder costs of around 30 trillion won.We are asking for eased procedures to revise employment rules in order to reform the seniority-based wage system.Young workers are among the most anxious.They worry that extending the retirement age could reduce new hiring.Kim Seol / Chair, Youth Community UnionThere needs to be broader social discussion that takes into account young people&#x27;s concerns about employment opportunities and expansion.The debate on extending the retirement age is expected to intensify this year.There are concerns that without careful design, the plan could exacerbate labor-management tensions and generational conflict.■ 제보하기▷ 전화 : 02-781-1234, 4444▷ 이메일 : kbs1234@kbs.co.kr▷ 카카오톡 : &#x27;KBS제보&#x27; 검색, 채널 추가▷ 네이버, 유튜브에서 KBS뉴스를 구독해주세요!
