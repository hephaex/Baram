football club-playersUlsan HD parting ways with attackers amid busy offseasonBy Yoo Jee-ho SEOUL, Jan. 2 (Yonhap) -- Continuing their squad overhaul in the aftermath of a disappointing season, Ulsan HD FC announced Friday they will part ways with attackers Gustav Ludwigson and Um Won-sang. Ludwigson, a winger from Sweden, had played for Ulsan for the past three seasons in the K League 1, while Um had been with Ulsan since 2022.

Ulsan won three consecutive K League 1 titles from 2022 to 2024 but finished in ninth place in 2025 with 44 points, just two points out of the relegation zone. Ludwigson netted 18 goals and had 11 assists in 85 matches for Ulsan, including five goals to rank third on the club in 2025. Um enjoyed the best season of his seven-year K League career in 2022 by scoring a team-high 12 goals. However, Um failed to reach double figures in goals in each of the next three seasons while being hobbled by knee injuries. In 2025, Um only managed one goal with five assists in 30 matches. Earlier in the offseason, veteran midfielder Jung Woo-young announced he was leaving Ulsan after two seasons. Ulsan went through two head coaches last year, with Shin Tae-yong, the second bench boss, leaving under the cloud of allegations that he had physically and verbally abused his players. On Christmas Eve, they announced their club legend Kim Hyun-seog as the new head coach.
