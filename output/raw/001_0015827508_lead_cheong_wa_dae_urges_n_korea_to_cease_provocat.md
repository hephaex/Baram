(LEAD) Cheong Wa Dae-NK missile(LEAD) Cheong Wa Dae urges N. Korea to cease provocations following missile launch(ATTN: ADDS more details in paras 5-6, 8-9, byline)By Kim Eun-jung SEOUL, Jan. 4 (Yonhap) -- The Office of National Security at the presidential office of Cheong Wa Dae held an emergency meeting Sunday after North Korea fired multiple ballistic missiles into the East Sea and urged Pyongyang to cease provocations. The meeting was convened by Deputy National Security Adviser Lim Jong-deuk and attended by officials from the defense ministry and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to analyze and assess the North&#x27;s latest missile launch and review South Korea&#x27;s military readiness, according to Cheong Wa Dae. &quot;North Korea&#x27;s launch of ballistic missiles constitutes a provocative act in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, and we urge the North to cease such actions,&quot; the national security office said in a release. The South Korean military said it detected the launches from an area near Pyongyang at around 7:50 a.m.

The North Korean missiles flew some 900 kilometers, the JCS said, noting the South Korean and U.S. authorities were analyzing the exact details of the launch. It was the North&#x27;s first weapons test this year, following its last ballistic missile launch in November. The launches came just hours before President Lee Jae Myung was set to depart for Beijing for summit talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. They also followed an announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump that Washington had captured Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro in a large-scale military operation. North Korea is expected to feature prominently in Lee&#x27;s summit with Xi on Monday as Seoul seeks to secure Beijing&#x27;s support to improve strained ties with Pyongyang and make progress in the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. In recent weeks, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has toured several factories, including a nuclear-powered submarine facility and a munitions plant producing tactical guided weapons, ahead of the ninth party congress expected in the coming weeks. ejkim@yna.co.kr(END)
