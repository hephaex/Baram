Hanwha Systems-Philippine Navy Hanwha Systems wins 40 bln-won combat system supply deal from Philippine Navy SEOUL, Dec. 31 (Yonhap) -- Hanwha Systems Co., a defense solutions unit of South Korea&#x27;s Hanwha Group, said Wednesday it has won a 40 billion-won (US$27.7 million) contract to supply advanced combat management systems (CMS) to the Philippine Navy, marking the fifth such deal with the Southeast Asian country. Under the deal, Hanwha Systems will provide CMS and tactical data links (TDL) for the Philippine Navy&#x27;s two 3,200-ton next-generation frigates. A CMS works as the brain of a vessel and is designed to integrate all equipment, like sensors, weapons and communications systems, into one single system to help counter threats more efficiently. A TDL enables naval units to share tactical information in real time. Hanwha Systems said the equipment will be custom tailored to the Philippines&#x27; operational environment, which spans across over 7,600 islands. The latest deal adds to Hanwha Systems&#x27; past systems supply contracts with the Philippine Navy since 2017. Hanwha Systems said it has developed the CMS entirely with proprietary technology and has supplied them to a wide range of surface and underwater vessels used by the South Korean Navy.
