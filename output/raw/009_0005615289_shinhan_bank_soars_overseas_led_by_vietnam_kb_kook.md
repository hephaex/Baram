Shinhan Bank continued its strong overseas performance in 2025, emerging as the clear leader among South Korea’s four major banks, while KB Kookmin Bank successfully returned to profitability after losses the previous year.According to industry sources on Thursday, the four major banks generated a combined 1.55 trillion won ($1.09 billion) in overseas net profit through the third quarter of 2025. Shinhan Bank accounted for the largest share, posting 628.7 billion won, or roughly 41 percent of the total. It was followed by Hana Bank with 440.9 billion won, Woori Bank with 265.1 billion won, and KB Kookmin Bank with 218.5 billion won.Shinhan Bank is on track to achieve its strongest-ever overseas results, driven largely by solid performance in Vietnam and Japan. Market watchers expect the bank’s overseas net profit to reach the 800-billion-won range in 2025, raising expectations that the combined overseas earnings of the four major banks could surpass 1 trillion won this year.By contrast, Hana Bank has remained stuck in the 500-billion-won range for three consecutive years, while Woori Bank has seen its overseas performance deteriorate due to internal control issues and weak results at its Indonesian subsidiary.The four major banks earned 1.39 trillion won overseas in 2022, rising further to 1.64 trillion won in 2023. However, profits fell back to 1.4526 trillion won in 2024, largely due to KB Kookmin Bank’s underperforming Indonesian unit and Woori Bank’s sluggish results. KB Kookmin Bank, which recorded 213.7 billion won in overseas profit in 2023, swung to a loss of 202.6 billion won in 2024.In 2025, however, KB Kookmin Bank returned to the black, posting 218.5 billion won in net profit through the third quarter, helped by stabilization at its Indonesian subsidiary. With conditions improving, the bank is expected to pursue minority stake investments this year, as entry conditions are seen as relatively favorable.Hana Bank and Woori Bank, meanwhile, continue to face headwinds. Hana Bank earned 553.2 billion won overseas in 2023, but its profit slipped to 538.3 billion won in 2024. Through the third quarter of 2025, it has posted 440.9 billion won, making it unlikely to surpass the 600-billion-won mark for the full year.Woori Bank’s overseas net profit peaked at 457 billion won in 2022, before shrinking to 383.3 billion won in 2024 and further down to 265.1 billion won through the third quarter of 2025. Weak performance at its Indonesian subsidiary Bank Woori Saudara, coupled with overseas financial incidents, weighed heavily on results.Pressure on overseas performance is expected to intensify further in 2026, as domestic lending — including mortgage loans — remains constrained by regulatory oversight. Banks are also facing tighter management of risk-weighted assets (RWA) as they expand corporate lending, increasing the need for stronger overseas earnings.Shinhan Bank plans to maintain its two core growth pillars in Vietnam and Japan, while gradually introducing artificial intelligence-based services at overseas branches to strengthen digital competitiveness.Hana Bank aims to expand channels in response to rising demand from Korean companies entering the U.S. market, leveraging its foreign exchange expertise rooted in its legacy as an FX-focused bank. The bank plans to extend its global foreign exchange trading platform, launched last year starting in London, to Germany and Singapore.Woori Bank, which has been hit hard by overseas internal control failures, said it will prioritize preventing further incidents while accelerating a shift toward digital-centric operations in Southeast Asia. The bank also plans to pursue investment banking deals and large-scale transactions through overseas hubs in Singapore, London, and New York.
