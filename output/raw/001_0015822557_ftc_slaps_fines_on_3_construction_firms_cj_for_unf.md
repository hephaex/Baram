FTC-internal deals FTC slaps fines on 3 construction firms, CJ for unfair internal deals SEOUL, Dec. 31 (Yonhap) -- The Fair Trade Commission (FTC) said Wednesday it has imposed fines totaling 93.5 billion won (US$64.8 million) on three construction companies and CJ Group for illegal inter-subsidiary transactions. The FTC said it fined Daebang Construction Co., JungHeung Construction Co., Woomi Co. and CJ Group, and referred them to the prosecution following a government investigation into unfair internal deals related to public land development projects. The commission fined Daebang Construction for providing improper support to affiliated companies owned by the chairman&#x27;s family by transferring the ownership of public housing sites, expected to yield massive development returns. JungHeung was sanctioned for allegedly providing free guarantees worth trillions of won to a company owned by a family member of the chairman. Food-to-entertainment conglomerate CJ Group was accused of illegally injecting funds into a troubled affiliate through derivatives. Woomi, a midsized real estate developer, was slapped with fines for the alleged funneling of large-scale construction projects to its affiliates, including a company owned by the chairman&#x27;s family member.
