# Musinsa rolls out New Year coupon pack

South Korean fashion platform Musinsa Co. launched a New Year promotion on Thursday, offering discount coupons worth a total of 50,000 won ($34.6) to its users.The promotion includes 20,000 won for the Musinsa Store, 20,000 for Musinsa Shoes, 5,000 won for Musinsa Beauty, and 5,000 won for Musinsa Used, the company’s secondhand marketplace.The coupons can be applied to eligible products in each category, with a minimum purchase of 90,000 won required for items in the Musinsa Store and Shoes categories.The campaign has attracted attention as it comes shortly after similar promotional credit offerings by e-commerce giant Coupang Inc.Some online users have noted similarities between Musinsa’s coupon structure and Coupang’s recently announced 50,000 won compensation package, citing the identical breakdown of discount amounts.Others have pointed to the color scheme used in Musinsa’s promotional materials, which they say resembles Coupang’s branding.Last week, Coupang announced a compensation plan after a large-scale data breach that affected 33.7 million users, offering shopping credits worth 50,000 won per person.The package includes 20,000 won for Coupang Travel, 20,000 won for its luxury platform R.LUX, 5,000 won applicable to all products, and 5,000 won for its food delivery service, Coupang Eats.However, the compensation has faced criticism over its practical value, as a relatively small portion of the credits can be used for everyday purchases, while the larger share is limited to travel and luxury services.Some users noted that Musinsa’s discounts are focused on its core fashion and footwear categories, which may make the coupons easier to apply in practice.
