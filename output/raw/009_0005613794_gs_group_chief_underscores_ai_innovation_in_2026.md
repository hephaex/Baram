Huh Tae-soo, chairman of South Korea’s GS Group, called for strengthening core business competitiveness and maximizing the business impact of artificial intelligence (AI) as key strategies to secure competitiveness in 2026.According to GS Group on Monday, Huh emphasized in his New Year message that the structural changes surrounding the energy and chemical industries “are unlikely to be resolved in the short term amid a continued low oil price environment and the possibility of weakening demand.”“Rather than merely watching these changes, 2026 must be a year in which we act one step ahead and complete them through tangible results,” he added.Huh continued that “if we fail to protect the competitiveness of our existing businesses, no future can be guaranteed.”He stressed the need for meticulous execution to prepare for risks. At the same time, he underscored that clear opportunities still exist even in a rapidly changing market environment.Huh also made clear his intention to designate 2026 as the inaugural year for AI-driven business.“Our employees have continued to make numerous new attempts using AI as a tool, and those efforts are increasingly translating into changes on the ground,” Huh said. “By combining the field-oriented domain knowledge we have accumulated with physical AI, and through bold partnerships with external technology companies, I ask that you demonstrate real business impact.”
